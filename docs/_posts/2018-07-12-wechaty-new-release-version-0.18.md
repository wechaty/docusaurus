All about Wechaty v0.18 is to: Reduce Weight!

With v0.17, we have 27,630 source line of code with 377 unit tests(you can check it out at [here](https://github.com/Chatie/wechaty/blob/01bfdf96c8023f44fa2ad2762f8f12fee875e42e/tests/README.md) if you are interested).

Start from v0.18, we have 7,817 lines of code left(v0.17 is 353% of this!), with 10+ related npm modules.

<!--more-->

Let's back to May 2016, when the first version of Wechaty was published, it only contains thousands of lines of the code, and at the end of the year 2016, we have about 10,000 lines of the code. (you can read our [blog](https://blog.chatie.io/welcome-to-wechaty/) at this time)

As the time passed by in 2017 & 2018, we added more features to Wechaty, like send attachment files, support WeChat protocol other than web like ipad, which means we write more and more codes in Wechaty repository... at last we get almost 30,000 lines of the code, and to be precise: 27,630. (with 377 unit tests, you can check it out at [here](https://github.com/Chatie/wechaty/blob/01bfdf96c8023f44fa2ad2762f8f12fee875e42e/tests/README.md) if you are interested)

Is that fat? 30,000 lines of the code, is not too much, but it is not a small number too. After we finished abstracting the puppet base class after v0.16, it seems we have very good reason to begin reducing weight:

1. Abstract Puppet Class need to be imported by every puppet implementations, and it should to be a solo npm module, with good version management.
1. Every Puppet Implentation Class is better to be a solo npm module, becasue we can only install the required source code that we needed.

So at this version (v0.18), we have the follow npm modules that splited out from Wechaty:

Hmm... lots of them aha? So how can we keep all of them in one repository and manage them easily? It must be a nightmare!

So at last, as we published the v0.18, we only left 3,853 source lines of the code in Wechaty repository(7,817 physical lines). We can see a timeline from the history:

### Source Lines of Code for Wechaty

| Date | SLOC | Factor(%) |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| 2016.5 | 3,000 | 38% |
| 2017.1 | 10,000 | 128% |

| 2018.6 | 27,630 | 353% |
| 2018.7 | 7,817 | 100% |

From 27,630 to 7,817, we are 72% off than before, cheers!
