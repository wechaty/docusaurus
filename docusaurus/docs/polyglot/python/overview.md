You can find more information on [Python-Wechaty-getting started](https://github.com/wechaty/python-wechaty-getting-started).The [General Architecture Diagram](https://wechaty.js.org/docs/polyglot/diy/) illustrates on how the Python-Wechaty can be implemented on the existing TypeScript Wechaty ecosystem.

## Getting Started

You can run the below commands for starting the Wechaty-Python.

```sh

cd python-wechaty-getting-started
make install
make bot

## Translation of TypeScript to Python

As the basic ecosystem of Wechaty is in TypeScript, we only need to translate it to Python. There is a hundred (100) lines of code in class named Image in charge of downloading the WeChat image to different sizes.
Below are the links to `Image` class for both TypeScript and Python for better understanding of the code and the translation.

* TypeScript: <https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/blob/master/src/user/image.ts>
* Python: <https://github.com/wechaty/python-wechaty/blob/master/src/wechaty/user/image.py>
