Go-Wechaty is the Go- Programming language client.Wechaty is already is implemented in TypeScript so can be easily translated to Go language as Wechaty has only three thousand (3,000) lines of the TypeScript code, they are well designed and de-coupled by the wechaty-puppet abstraction.Wechaty already has an ecosystem in TypeScript, so you will not have to implement everything in Go, especially, in the Feb 2020, we have finished the grpc service abstracting module with the wechaty-puppet-service implementation.

The [Polyglot Architecture Diagram](https://wechaty.js.org/docs/polyglot/diy/) illustrates on how the Wechaty-Go can be implemented on the already existing TypeScript Wechaty ecosystem.
