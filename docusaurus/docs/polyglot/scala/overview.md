Scala Wechaty is a Scala programming client derived from the Wechaty ecosystem. Scala's static types help avoid bugs in complex applications, hence Scala wechaty is very easy to use, implement and is also very efficient. You can find more information on Scala-Wechaty [here](https://github.com/wechaty/scala-wechaty-getting-started). The [General Architecture Diagram](https://wechaty.js.org/docs/polyglot/diy/) illustrates how the Scala-Wechaty can be implemented on the already existing TypeScript Wechaty ecosystem.

## Features of Scala-Wechaty

* Stable interaction with back-end gRPC, continuous and stable operation.
* The front end implements some functions of `Contact` and `Message`.

## Getting Started

Run the below command for starting the Scala-Wechaty bot.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:wechaty/scala-wechaty-getting-started.git

export WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-hostie
export WECHATY_PUPPET_HOSTIE_TOKEN=your_token_at_here
make bot # or
scala examples/ding-dong-bot.scala 
```

## Translation of TypeScript to Scala

There is a hundred (100) lines class named `Image` in charge of downloading the WeChat image to different sizes. Below are the links to the Image class for both TypeScript and Scala for a better understanding of the code and the translation.

* TypeScript: <https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/blob/master/src/user/image.ts>
* Scala: <https://github.com/wechaty/scala-wechaty/blob/master/wechaty/src/main/scala/wechaty/user/Image.scala>
