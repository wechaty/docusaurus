For different instant messaging (IM) systems (such as WeChat, Whatsapp, and TikTok), the Wechaty community builds separate RPA modules for each, and we call those modules [Wechaty Puppet](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet).

Wechaty Puppet Provider is an NPM module for a specific IM protocol Wechaty Puppet.

```sh
npm install wechaty-puppet-NAME
export WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-NAME
npm start
```

> You can switch between different Wechaty Puppet Provider by changing your `WECHATY_PUPPET` environment variable. All your source code should work between different tokens without any changes.
