WhatsApp is the most popular Instance Messaging service in many parts of the world. With the WhatsApp Wechaty Puppet Provider, you can reach more than 1.5 billion WhatsApp users. You can send notifications, have two-way conversations, by building chatbots. If you're trying to reach and better converse with users in the west world, you need to consider using WhatsApp.

With the introduction of wechaty puppet and the growth of the wechaty ecosystem and community, we’re happy to introduce wechaty-puppet-whatsapp which connects Wechaty API, the conversational RPA SDK for chatbot makers, and WhatsApp, a free, multi-platform messaging app.

## Integrating a Bot to Whatsapp

Let's take up an example on how to integrate bot from [starter templete](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started) to Whatsapp.

The steps are similar for all other bots as well.

### Prerequisite

1. Offical Wechaty package: [package/wechaty](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wechaty).
2. QRCode terminal edition: [package/qrcode-terminal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode-terminal).

You can follow up the steps mentioned below:

<ol><li> Initialize the project by creating a new folder `my-bot`.</li>

```bash
mkdir my-bot
cd my-bot
```

<li> Install the dependencies using the following commands:</li>

```bash
npm install wechaty
npm install qrcode-terminal
```

<li> Add the dependencies for using the bot with Whatsapp.</li>

```bash
npm install wechaty-puppet-whatsapp
```

<li> Create a new folder `src` and add a file `my-bot.js`. Add your custom functions to the code snippet below:</li>

```ts
  
import {
  Wechaty,
  ScanStatus,
  log,
}               from 'wechaty'

import qrcodeTerminal from 'qrcode-terminal'

console.log(welcome)
const bot = new Wechaty()

/*
 *Your function goes here
 */
```

<li> After you are done with the file, you can run the bot using the following commands:</li></ol>

```bash
export WECHATY_LOG=verbose
export WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-whatsapp
node src/my-bot.js
```

Scan it using your Whatsapp and you are ready to play with the bot! You can read more about deploying a whatsapp puppet [here](https://wechaty.js.org/docs/howto/deploy-whatsapp/).
