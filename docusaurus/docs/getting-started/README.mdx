With just a few lines of code, your WeChat/Whatsapp account will be turned into a chatbot, a.k.a [Conversational User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversational_user_interface) Automation Software. With the power of the Wechaty [Conversational RPA](../introduction/rpa.md) technology, your chatbot will have conversations on behalf of you, and can do whatever you want to do.
