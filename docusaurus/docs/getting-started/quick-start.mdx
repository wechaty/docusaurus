## Setting up development envioronment :

1. Install Node.js v12+.
2. Git clone wechaty-getting-started repo
3. Install system depending packages

**1. Install Node.js **

Node.js has been pre-installed in Google-Cloud Shell already.

**2. Git clone wechaty-getting-started repo with ``git clone ``.**

The **Git Repo **has been already cloned in **Google Cloud Shell**.

**3. Install system dependancy packages**

The puppeteer needs ```libgbm 1``` to be presented in the system, we need to install it first, run :

```sudo apt install -y libgbml ```

Follow the instructions to install required dependancies.  

![Wechaty shell instructions to execute](../../static/img/docs/getting-started/cloud-execution-instructions.png)

#### Next, install NPM :

Install the NPM packages with ```npm install```.

![Dependancy installation with NPM](../../static/img/docs/getting-started/cloud-npm-installation.png)

### Now we are ready to get started with our ding-dong bot!

Its source code is in ```examples/ding-dong-bot.ts```.

#### Lets try running Ding-Dong Bot with Whatsapp :

To start our bot with whatsapp, we need to define WECHATY_PUPPET = wechaty-puppet-whatsapp. Run the following on the terminal :

```
export \
WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-whatsapp
npm start
```

You will see a **QR Code** appear on the **cloud terminal**. **Scan** it with your **Whatsapp scanner.**.

![Scan Whatsapp QR Code from terminal page](../../static/img/docs/getting-started/cloud-scan-QR-whatsapp.png)

### Now you will be able to play with the ding-dong-bot! The messages received on whatsapp will also be displayed on the cloud terminal.

![Whatsapp messages displayed on google cloud terminal](../../static/img/docs/getting-started/getting-started-terminal-messages.png)

If you have finished the previous step, and login-ed successfully, then your bot will be able to reply a dong for any message send it as a ding, no matter which IM(Whatsapp or WeChat) your bot is working with. You can even add your own features!

#### Now if you get a new feature request from your client: reply dongdong for dingding, you can do it super fast! Just updated the onMessage function in your ding-dong-bot.ts file!

```
async function onMessage (msg: Message) {
  log.info('StarterBot', msg.toString())

  if (msg.text() === 'ding') {
    await msg.say('dong')
  }
  if (msg.text() === 'dingding') {
    await msg.say('dongdong')
  }
}
```

#### That's it! We have added 3 lines of code to implment our new feature. Do not forget to save the file changes to the disk.

Next up, start your brand new new ding-dong BOT and test your new feature! Once you complete the tutorial, you will be directed to the completion page.

### Congratulations, you did it!
