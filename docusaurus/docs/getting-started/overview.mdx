If you are a total beginner to Wechaty, start from this section. 

You can run Wechaty on following platforms:

- [Google Cloud Shell](getting-started/quick-start.mdx)
- [Gitpod](getting-started/quick-start.mdx)
- [Locally on your machine](getting-started/running-locally.mdx)

Wechaty is a RPA (Robotic Process Automation) SDK for Chatbot Makers which can help you create a bot in 6 lines of [JavaScript](https://GitHub.com/Wechaty/wechaty), [Python](https://GitHub.com/Wechaty/python-wechaty/), [Go](https://GitHub.com/Wechaty/go-wechaty/), and [Java](https://GitHub.com/Wechaty/java-wechaty/), with cross-platform support including [Linux, Windows, MacOS](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/actions?query=workflow%3ANPM), and [Docker](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/actions?query=workflow%3ADocker).

You will learn the following fundamental features of Wechaty in the getting-started tutorials:

- Turn different instant messaging (IM) systems (such as WeChat, Wecom，Whatsapp, Lark，Gitter, and TikTok) account into chatbot.
- Use the chatbot to communicate or do anything on behalf of you.
- Work out of the box on Linux, Mac and Windows.
- Supports all [puppets](../puppet-services) like Wechat, WhatsApp, WeCom, Lark and so on.
- Reply with a `dong` message when it recieves a `ding` message.
