**Wechaty Plugin** is a JavaScript function that accepts a Wechaty instance and helps to avoid repetitive code.

Wechaty has great support for various plugins both in-house and contributed by the community. They can be imported as a NPM package, and can be accessed by calling `Wechaty.use(WechatyPlugin())`.

The first Wechaty Plugin system was design by our Wechaty Committer [@gcaufy](https://github.com/gcaufy), you can get more information about it [here](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/pull/1946).
