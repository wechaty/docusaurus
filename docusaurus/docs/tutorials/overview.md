These tutorials take you by the hand through a series of steps to create a chatbot application.

## Build your first chatbot with wechaty

If you are a total beginner to Wechaty or chatbot application development in general, we recommend you to start from the [Getting started](getting-started/overview.mdx) tutorials. In these tutorials you'll be building a **ding-dong bot** which replies with a `dong` message when it recieves a `ding` message.

The fastest way to get started with Wechaty is to use a Cloud based IDE for **running the bot**. To understand how it works, You can either use:

- [Gitpod](getting-started/quick-start.mdx)
- [Google Cloud Shell](getting-started/quick-start.mdx)

If you are a total begginer then we recommend using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started).

Once you get basic idea of ding-dong bot, you can try out building it from scratch by following our [Running Locally](getting-started/hard-way.mdx) tutorial.

## Advanced Tutorials (Using plugins with wechaty)

If you have some experience with Wechaty or Chatbot application development, we have intermediate to advanced tutorials on the following topics as well.
