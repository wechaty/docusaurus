## What is an SDK

A **software development kit (SDK)** is a toolkit used by developers to create applications for a specific platform, operating system or device. A typical SDK contains libraries, packaged APIs, code samples, compilers, debuggers, drivers, network protocols, integrated development environments (IDE), documentation, and different files that help developers create applications for different platforms.

In order to create an application, developers need a software development kit, which serves as the foundation of the application to be built. Without an SDK, developers would need to create everything from scratch. But with an SDK, it would be easier to add new features from time to time, enhance the creation of an application and make the development processes work seamlessly. With Wechaty, developers just have to decide which IM platform they prefer to create their chatbots with, and they can instantly modify it according to their business needs.

## What is conversation

> Conversation is interactive communication between two or more people. The development of conversational skills and etiquette is an important part of socialization — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation).

## What is conversational UI

> A conversational interface (CUI) is a user interface for computers that emulates a conversation with a real human. Historically, computers have relied on text-based user interfaces and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as the user pressing the "back" button to translate the user's desired action into commands the computer understands — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversational_user_interface).

It is a type of user interface that enables computers to interact with people on human terms. It allows users to interact with applications modeled after human conversation, through chatbots and voice assistants. Some of the most famous conversational UIs are Siri, Cortana, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant.

With the help of chat interface, chatbots can interact with users based on user queries.

## What is conversational AI

**Conversational AI** is the technology that makes it possible for chatbots and humans to communicate. By supplying the data needed to build a conversation, a conversational AI makes it possible to engage in a dialogue on any topic.

It makes it possible for humans to communicate with computers the way humans communicate with each other. By bridging the gap between humans and computer languages, it makes communication between the two simple and natural.

Like other AI mechanisms, chatbots can be used to improve the capabilities of people and free them up, making them more creative, productive and innovative, and spending more time on strategic rather than tactical activities.
