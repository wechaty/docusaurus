Using redux with Wechaty wraps Wechaty with Redux Actions &amp; Reducers for Easy State Management.

[Redux](https://redux.js.org) is a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments.

- Make the state predictable
- Easier to trace which action causes any change
- Make it easier to test, maintain and debug the code
