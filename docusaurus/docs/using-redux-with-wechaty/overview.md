Using redux with Wechaty wraps Wechaty with Redux Actions &amp; Reducers for Easy State Management.

[Redux](https://redux.js.org) is a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments.

Redux is used for application state management and offers the following benefits:

- Make the state predictable
- Easier to trace which action causes any change
- Make it easier to test, maintain and debug the code
