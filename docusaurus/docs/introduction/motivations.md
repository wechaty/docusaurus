As the requirements for Conversational applications such as chatbot have become increasingly complicated, **we need to focus on our business instead of the code itself**.

## Connecting ChatBots

- Wechaty is a Last-mile technology for bringing chatbot to end-users.
- Wechaty is a ChatBot Framework for Business.

Wechaty is designed to help you straightforward implement your chatbot business logic and keep focus, without the care about any unrelated complex dirty underwater works.

## The Creator's Story

In 2017 ...

Huan's daily life/work depends on too much chat on wechat.

- Almost 14,000 wechat friends in May 2014, before wechat restricts a total number of friends to 5,000.
- Almost 400 wechat rooms, and most of them have more than 400 members.

Can you imagine that? He was dying...

So a tireless bot working for me 24x7 on wechat, monitoring/filtering the most important message is badly needed. For example, it highlights discussion which contains the KEYWORDS which he want to follow up(especially in a noisy room). ;-)

At last, It's built for huan's personal study purpose of Automatically Testing.
