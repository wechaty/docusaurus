## Conversational {#conversational}

Wechaty is a Conversational SDK.

1. What is [Conversational](#what-is-conversational)?
1. What is [Conversational User Interface (CUI)](#conversational-user-interface)?
1. What is [Conversational AI](#conversational-ai)?

### 1. What is Conversational {#what-is-conversational}

> Conversation is interactive communication between two or more people. The development of conversational skills and etiquette is an important part of socialization. &mdash; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation)

### 2. What is Conversational User Interface (CUI) {#conversational-user-interface}

> A conversational interface (CUI) is a user interface for computers that emulates a conversation with a real human. Historically, computers have relied on text-based user interfaces and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) (such as the user pressing a "back" button) to translate the user's desired action into commands the computer understands.
> &mdash; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversational_user_interface)

With the help of the chat interface, chatbots can chat with users based on their queries. The best part of this app is: you can use it with many other apps and establish convenient communication without any obstacles.

### 3. What is Conversational AI {#conversational-ai}

Conversational AI is the technology that makes computers to speak human and communicate the way like us to be possible. It allows artificial intelligence (AI) technologies like chatbots to interact with people in a humane way. By bridging the gap between humans and computer languages, it makes communication between the two easy and natural.

Like other AI mechanisms, chatbots will be used to improve the capabilities of people and free them up, making them more creative, productive and innovative, and spending more time on strategic rather than tactical activities.

## RPA: Robotic Process Automation {#rpa}

Wechaty is a RPA SDK.

1. What is [RPA](#what-is-rpa)?
1. Why [Conversational RPA](#conversational-rpa)?

### 1. What is RPA (Robotic Process Automation) {#what-is-rpa}

> Robotic Process Automation is the technology that allows anyone today to configure computer software, or a “robot” to emulate and integrate the actions of a human interacting within digital systems to execute a business process. RPA robots utilize the user interface to capture data and manipulate applications just like humans do. They interpret, trigger responses and communicate with other systems in order to perform on a vast variety of repetitive tasks. Only substantially better: an RPA software robot never sleeps and makes zero mistakes.
> &mdash; [UIPath](https://www.uipath.com/rpa/robotic-process-automation)

### 2. Why Conversational RPA {#conversational-rpa}

Conversational RPA (cRPA) Connecting any chatbot system to Conversational AI. We developed this as an SDK published in GitHub and this module can be set for any Conversationl AI/Chatbot system that the enterprise prefers.
