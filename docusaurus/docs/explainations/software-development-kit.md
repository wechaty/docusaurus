In order to create an application, developers need a software development kit, which serves as the foundation of the application to be built. Without an SDK, developers would need to create everything from scratch. But with an SDK, it would be easier to add new features from time to time, enhance the creation of an application and make the development processes work seamlessly. With Wechaty, developers just have to decide which IM platform they prefer to create their chatbots with, and they can instantly modify it according to their business needs.

## What is an SDK

A **software development kit (SDK)** is a toolkit used by developers to create applications for a specific platform, operating system or device. A typical SDK contains libraries, packaged APIs, code samples, compilers, debuggers, drivers, network protocols, integrated development environments (IDE), documentation, and different files that help developers create applications for different platforms.

## What is RPA

**Robotic process automation (RPA)** refers to the technology that allows users to configure software robots to execute business processes and automate repetitive tasks across applications and systems without human intervention. With RPA, numerous and repetitious business processes are streamlined and manual backend workflows are automated. With the integration of RPA with chatbots, an intelligent and superb end-to end user experience is achieved.

## What is conversational UI and AI

**Conversational UI** is a type of user interface that enables computers to interact with people on human terms. It allows users to interact with applications modeled after human conversation, through chatbots and voice assistants. Some of the most famous conversational UIs are Siri, Cortana, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant.

**Conversational AI** is the technology that makes it possible for chatbot and human communication on different instant messaging apps. By supplying the data needed to build a conversation, a conversational AI makes it possible to engage in dialogue on any topic.
