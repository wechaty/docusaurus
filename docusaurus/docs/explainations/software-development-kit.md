## What is an SDK

A **software development kit (SDK)** is a toolkit used by developers to create applications for a specific platform, operating system or device. A typical SDK contains libraries, packaged APIs, code samples, compilers, debuggers, drivers, network protocols, integrated development environments (IDE), documentation, and different files that help developers create applications for different platforms.

In order to create an application, developers need a software development kit, which serves as the foundation of the application to be built. Without an SDK, developers would need to create everything from scratch. But with an SDK, it would be easier to add new features from time to time, enhance the creation of an application and make the development processes work seamlessly. With Wechaty, developers just have to decide which IM platform they prefer to create their chatbots with, and they can instantly modify it according to their business needs.
