## About Wechaty project

### The project’s problem

Users come to Wechaty website and are seeking how to use Wechaty to build a chatbot application for solving their problems. Unfortunately, the learning curve is not friendly to our users, they always struggle with setting up with their development environment, can not getting started with the simpliest example source code, and hard to know what they can do with our API. This problem leads us lost lots of new users, increased the number of questions asked in the community, and lowered the user satisfication.

Our current version of the [Tutorials](../tutorials/overview.md) is totally a messy structure because they were not planned properly to begin with.

We need to improve the tutorials on our website, the better it is, the happier our user are!

### The project’s scope

Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete running Wechaty code. They are what our project needs in order to show a beginner that they can achieve something with it.

They are wholly learning-oriented, and specifically, they are oriented towards learning how rather than learning that.

Tutorials need to be useful for the beginner, easy to follow, meaningful and extremely robust, and kept up-to-date.

The Tutorial project should:

- Allow the user to learn by doing
- Get the user started
- Make sure that the tutorial works all the time
- Ensure the user sees results immediately
- Make the tutorial repeatable
- Focus on concrete steps, not abstract concepts
- Provide the minimum necessary explanation
- Focus only on the steps the user needs to take
- Work with the contributor team to update the documentation on the Wechaty site.

### What is out-of-scope for this project

- This project is not an API reference, it can link to related pages for references.
- This project is not for experienced users

We have two committer candidates for this project, and we estimate that this work will take three months to complete.
The creator of Wechaty [@huan](https://wechaty.js.org/contributors/huan) (the core maintainer of the whole ecosystem) have committed to supporting the project.

## Measuring your project’s success

At today, tutorials on our site receives 60% of pageviews of total traffic,
the average visit duration is 1:30, the bounce rate is 70%.

We will track the above metrics (pageviews, visit duration, and bounce rate)
monthly after the documentation is published.
We will also track the number of user getting started questions,
starting quarterly after the documentation is published.

We would consider the project successful if, after publication of the new documentation:

- The tutorials pageviews increase by 50%
- The visit duration on tutorials increases by 50% (>2 minutes)
- The bounce rate of tutorials decrease 30% (<50%)
