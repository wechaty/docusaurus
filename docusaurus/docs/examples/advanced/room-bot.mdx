Room bot is a practical example which illustrates how to do room handling. With room bot you can do the following:

- Find a room
- Add people to the room
- Delete people from the room
- Change the room topic
- Monitor room events

## Try out the bot

[![Edit wechaty-room-bot](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/sbis04/wechaty-room-bot/tree/main/?fontsize=12&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Froom-bot.js&theme=dark)

You can try out the **Wechaty Room bot** using this interactive CodeSandbox.

There is a `TODO` where you have to specify one of your friends' name (the CodeSandbox can be edited by using the above button). After that just scan the generated QR code with the **WeChat** app, and you are ready to play with the bot!

## Requirements

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) v12+
1. [Wechaty Puppet Service TOKEN](https://wechaty.js.org/docs/puppet-services/) (if you want to use RPA protocols other than Web)

## Getting Started

Before getting started make sure you have `Node` installed on your system. If you do not have `Node.js` installed (or have a version below 12),
then you need to install the latest version of `Node.js` by following the links below:

:::note Node.js installation docs

* [Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#windows)
* [Linux\(Debian/Ubuntu\)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions)
* [macOS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#macos)

> Installation guide for `Node.js` in other platforms can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

:::

You can head over to [Building the bot](#building-the-bot) section to learn how to build the bot on your own.

Otherwise if you want to try out the bot on your local system, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the repository

Use the following command to clone the [Github repository](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started) and navigate to the directory.

```bash
https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started.git
cd wechaty-getting-started
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Install the `npm` packages required for running the bot using the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the bot

You have to export/set environment variables.

  values={[
    { label: 'Linux',   value: 'linux', },
    { label: 'macOS',   value: 'mac', },
    { label: 'Windows', value: 'windows', },
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="linux">

export WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-wechat
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac">

```bash

export WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-wechat
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">

```bash
set WECHATY_LOG=verbose
set WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-wechat
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> There are various Wechaty puppets available, you can know more about them [here](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started#working-with-different-puppets)

For running the bot, use the following command:

```bash
npx ts-node examples/advanced/room-bot.js
```

This will generate a QR code. Scan it using **Wechat/Whatsapp** and you are ready to go.

## Building the bot

Let's get started with building **room-bot** using Wechaty.

### 1. Initialise project

Create a new folder called `room-bot` and move into that directory.

```bash
mkdir room-bot
cd room-bot
```

Use the following command to initialise an npm project

```bash
npm init -y
```

### 2. Install dependencies

For building the room bot, you will require these dependencies:

* [wechaty](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wechaty): Official Wechaty package
* [qrcode-terminal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode-terminal): Displays the QR code

For installing these dependencies run the following commands:

- **For installing wechaty**

```bash
npm install wechaty
```

- **For installing qrcode-terminal**

```bash
npm install qrcode-terminal
```

You will also need to add dependencies for using any [Wechaty Puppet](https://wechaty.js.org/docs/puppet-providers/) 
which helps to integrate Wechaty with various **instant messaging (IM) systems** (such as WeChat, Whatsapp, and Gitter):

You can install wechaty-puppet as you like when using wechaty:

1. If you want to use whatsapp,you can install wechaty-puppet-whatsapp

```bash
npm install wechaty-puppet-whatsapp
```
2. If you want to use wechat, you can install wechaty-puppet-wechat

```bash
npm install wechaty-puppet-wechat
```

3. If you want to use wecom, you can install wechaty-puppet-wxwork

```bash
npm install wechaty-puppet-wxwork
```

You can find more puppet information here: https://wechaty.js.org/docs/puppet-providers/

Now, you are ready to write main code for bot.

### 3. Writing code for bot

Create a new folder called `src` and add a file `room-bot.js`. You will be writing code here.

Let's import required packages in `room-bot.js` file and create a `HELPER_CONTACT_NAME` variable which will be used to create a room.

```js
// TODO: Put the name of one of your friend here,
// or room create function will not work.
const HELPER_CONTACT_NAME = "huan";

const qrTerm = require("qrcode-terminal");

const { Wechaty, log } = require("wechaty");
```
Now, we will write some functions which will be required for handling different events returned by bot.

**manageDingRoom**

This function will help you find a room, join it, leave it and to change the topic of the room.

```js
async function manageDingRoom() {
  log.info("Bot", "manageDingRoom()");

  /**
   * Find Room
   */
  try {
    const room = await bot.Room.find({ topic: /^ding/i });
    if (!room) {
      log.warn("Bot", "there is no room topic ding(yet)");
      return;
    }
    log.info("Bot", 'start monitor "ding" room join/leave/topic event');

    /**
     * Event: Join
     */
    room.on("join", function (inviteeList, inviter) {
      log.verbose(
        "Bot",
        'Room EVENT: join - "%s", "%s"',
        inviteeList.map((c) => c.name()).join(", "),
        inviter.name()
      );
      console.log("room.on(join) id:", this.id);
      checkRoomJoin.call(this, room, inviteeList, inviter);
    });

    /**
     * Event: Leave
     */
    room.on("leave", (leaverList, remover) => {
      log.info(
        "Bot",
        'Room EVENT: leave - "%s" leave(remover "%s"), byebye',
        leaverList.join(","),
        remover || "unknown"
      );
    });

    /**
     * Event: Topic Change
     */
    room.on("topic", (topic, oldTopic, changer) => {
      log.info(
        "Bot",
        'Room EVENT: topic - changed from "%s" to "%s" by member "%s"',
        oldTopic,
        topic,
        changer.name()
      );
    });
  } catch (e) {
    log.warn("Bot", 'Room.find rejected: "%s"', e.stack);
  }
}
```

**checkRoomJoin**

This function checks who can send an invitation and who can't. If the invitation is sent by the owner, then a person can join room otherwise the invitation is cancelled and person has to resend `ding` to owner so that he can send him the new valid invitation.

```js
async function checkRoomJoin(room, inviteeList, inviter) {
  log.info(
    "Bot",
    'checkRoomJoin("%s", "%s", "%s")',
    await room.topic(),
    inviteeList.map((c) => c.name()).join(","),
    inviter.name()
  );

  try {
    // let to, content
    const userSelf = bot.userSelf();

    if (inviter.id !== userSelf.id) {
      await room.say(
        "RULE1: Invitation is limited to me, the owner only. Please do not invit people without notify me.",
        inviter
      );
      await room.say(
        'Please contact me: by send "ding" to me, I will re-send you a invitation. Now I will remove you out, sorry.',
        inviteeList
      );

      await room.topic("ding - warn " + inviter.name());
      setTimeout((_) => inviteeList.forEach((c) => room.del(c)), 10 * 1000);
    } else {
      await room.say("Welcome to my room! :)");

      let welcomeTopic;
      welcomeTopic = inviteeList.map((c) => c.name()).join(", ");
      await room.topic("ding - welcome " + welcomeTopic);
    }
  } catch (e) {
    log.error("Bot", "checkRoomJoin() exception: %s", e.stack);
  }
}
```

**putInRoom**

This function adds people to the room.

```js
async function putInRoom(contact, room) {
  log.info("Bot", 'putInRoom("%s", "%s")', contact.name(), await room.topic());

  try {
    await room.add(contact);
    setTimeout((_) => room.say("Welcome ", contact), 10 * 1000);
  } catch (e) {
    log.error("Bot", "putInRoom() exception: " + e.stack);
  }
}
```

**getOutRoom**

This function removes people from room, if they said `ding` inside a room.

```js
async function getOutRoom(contact, room) {
  log.info("Bot", 'getOutRoom("%s", "%s")', contact, room);

  try {
    await room.say('You said "ding" in my room, I will remove you out.');
    await room.del(contact);
  } catch (e) {
    log.error("Bot", "getOutRoom() exception: " + e.stack);
  }
}
```

**getHelperContact**

This function returns a *Helper contact* that you defined in the beginning.

```js
function getHelperContact() {
  log.info("Bot", "getHelperContact()");

  // create a new room at least need 3 contacts
  return bot.Contact.find({ name: HELPER_CONTACT_NAME });
}
```

**createDingRoom**

This function is used to create a room but if *Helper contact* is not found, then it asks you to set it first.

```js
async function createDingRoom(contact) {
  log.info("Bot", 'createDingRoom("%s")', contact);

  try {
    const helperContact = await getHelperContact();

    if (!helperContact) {
      log.warn("Bot", "getHelperContact() found nobody");
      await contact.say(`You don't have a friend called "${HELPER_CONTACT_NAME}",
                         because create a new room at least need 3 contacts, please set [HELPER_CONTACT_NAME] in the code first!`);
      return;
    }

    log.info("Bot", 'getHelperContact() ok. got: "%s"', helperContact.name());

    const contactList = [contact, helperContact];
    log.verbose("Bot", 'contactList: "%s"', contactList.join(","));

    await contact.say(
      `There isn't ding room. I'm trying to create a room with "${helperContact.name()}" and you`
    );
    const room = await bot.Room.create(contactList, "ding");
    log.info("Bot", 'createDingRoom() new ding room created: "%s"', room);

    await room.topic("ding - created");
    await room.say("ding - created");

    return room;
  } catch (e) {
    log.error("Bot", "getHelperContact() exception:", e.stack);
    throw e;
  }
}
```

Now initialising the bot by providing the name.

```js
const bot = new Wechaty({
  name: "room-bot",
  puppet: "wechaty-puppet-wechat4u"
});
```

Assigning proper functions to call when an event is triggered.

```js
bot
  .on("scan", (qrcode, status) => {
    qrTerm.generate(qrcode, { small: true });
    console.log(`${qrcode}\n[${status}] Scan QR Code in above url to login: `);
  })
  .on("logout", (user) => log.info("Bot", `"${user.name()}" logouted`))
  .on("error", (e) => log.info("Bot", "error: %s", e))
```

- When `scan` is triggered, it generates QR code.
- `logout` will display the name of the user along with the status `logouted`.
- `error` is used to notify if the bot encounters an error.

**Global Event: login**

This event gets the `user` and display the login status of the user. After that, it displays the `msg` saying `setting to manageDingRoom() after 3 seconds ... ` which means it will call `manageDingRoom` function after 3 seconds.

```js
.on("login", async function (user) {
    let msg = `${user.name()} logined`;

    log.info("Bot", msg);
    await this.say(msg);

    msg = `setting to manageDingRoom() after 3 seconds ... `;
    log.info("Bot", msg);
    await this.say(msg);

    setTimeout(manageDingRoom.bind(this), 3000);
  })
```

**Global Event: room-join**

`room-join` event lets people to join a respective room.

```js
.on("room-join", async function (room, inviteeList, inviter) {
    log.info(
      "Bot",
      'EVENT: room-join - Room "%s" got new member "%s", invited by "%s"',
      await room.topic(),
      inviteeList.map((c) => c.name()).join(","),
      inviter.name()
    );
    console.log("bot room-join room id:", room.id);
    const topic = await room.topic();
    await room.say(`welcome to "${topic}"!`, inviteeList[0]);
  })
```

**Global Event: room-leave**

This event removes people from room.

```js
.on("room-leave", async function (room, leaverList) {
    log.info(
      "Bot",
      'EVENT: room-leave - Room "%s" lost member "%s"',
      await room.topic(),
      leaverList.map((c) => c.name()).join(",")
    );
    const topic = await room.topic();
    const name = leaverList[0] ? leaverList[0].name() : "no contact!";
    await room.say(`kick off "${name}" from "${topic}"!`);
  })
```

**Global Event: room-topic**

Using this event, you can change the topic of the room.

```js
.on("room-topic", async function (room, topic, oldTopic, changer) {
    try {
      log.info(
        "Bot",
        'EVENT: room-topic - Room "%s" change topic from "%s" to "%s" by member "%s"',
        room,
        oldTopic,
        topic,
        changer
      );
      await room.say(
        `room-topic - change topic from "${oldTopic}" to "${topic}" by member "${changer.name()}"`
      );
    } catch (e) {
      log.error("Bot", "room-topic event exception: %s", e.stack);
    }
  })
```

**Global Event: message**

This event handles entry and exit in the room. If you send `ding` first time, then you will get an invitation but saying `ding` in a room leads to exiting the room. Similarly, if you say `dong` it will quit the room.

```js
.on("message", async function (msg) {
    if (msg.age() > 3 * 60) {
      log.info(
        "Bot",
        'on(message) skip age("%d") > 3 * 60 seconds: "%s"',
        msg.age(),
        msg
      );
      return;
    }

    const room = msg.room();
    const from = msg.from();
    const text = msg.text();

    if (!from) {
      return;
    }

    console.log(
      (room ? "[" + (await room.topic()) + "]" : "") +
        "<" +
        from.name() +
        ">" +
        ":" +
        msg
    );

    if (msg.self()) {
      return; // skip self
    }

    /**
     * `dong` will be the magic(toggle) word:
     *  bot will quit current room by herself.
     */
    if (/^dong$/i.test(text)) {
      if (room) {
        await room.say(
          "You said dong in the room, I will quit by myself!",
          from
        );
        await room.quit();
      } else {
        await from.say(
          'Nothing to do. If you say "dong" in a room, I will quit from the room.'
        );
      }
      return;
    }

    /**
     * `ding` will be the magic(toggle) word:
     *  1. say ding first time, will got a room invitation
     *  2. say ding in room, will be removed out
     */
    if (/^ding$/i.test(text)) {
      /**
       *  in-room message
       */
      if (room) {
        if (/^ding/i.test(await room.topic())) {
          /**
           * move contact out of room
           */
          await getOutRoom(from, room);
        }

        /**
         * peer to peer message
         */
      } else {
        /**
         * find room name start with "ding"
         */
        try {
          const dingRoom = await this.Room.find({ topic: /^ding/i });
          if (dingRoom) {
            /**
             * room found
             */
            log.info(
              "Bot",
              'onMessage: got dingRoom: "%s"',
              await dingRoom.topic()
            );

            if (await dingRoom.has(from)) {
              /**
               * speaker is already in room
               */
              const topic = await dingRoom.topic();
              log.info("Bot", "onMessage: sender has already in dingRoom");
              await dingRoom.say(
                `I found you have joined in room "${topic}"!`,
                from
              );
              await from.say(
                `no need to ding again, because you are already in room: "${topic}"`
              );
              // sendMessage({
              //   content: 'no need to ding again, because you are already in ding room'
              //   , to: sender
              // })
            } else {
              /**
               * put speaker into room
               */
              log.info(
                "Bot",
                'onMessage: add sender("%s") to dingRoom("%s")',
                from.name(),
                dingRoom.topic()
              );
              await from.say("ok, I will put you in ding room!");
              await putInRoom(from, dingRoom);
            }
          } else {
            /**
             * room not found
             */
            log.info("Bot", "onMessage: dingRoom not found, try to create one");
            /**
             * create the ding room
             */
            const newRoom = await createDingRoom(from);
            console.log("createDingRoom id:", newRoom.id);
            /**
             * listen events from ding room
             */
            await manageDingRoom();
          }
        } catch (e) {
          log.error(e);
        }
      }
    }
  })
```

Now, finally for starting the bot

```js
bot.start()
  .catch((e) => console.error(e));
```

### 4. Running the bot

In order to run the bot, you have to export/set environment variables with the type of puppet you want to use.
