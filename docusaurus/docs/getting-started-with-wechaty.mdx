![Wechaty: Conversational RPA SDK for Chatbot Makers](/img/wechaty-logo.svg)

We have made it very easy to start writing Wechaty code in any of the supported programming languages. You need a few lines of code to turn your WeChat or Whatsapp account into a chatbot. Your chatbot will have conversations on behalf of you with Wechaty Conversational [RPA](#placeholder-link) technology.

We have set up a Wechaty [getting-started repository](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started) to help you start writing code in a couple of minutes. The Wechaty [getting-started repository](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started) contains code for a bot which we refer to as the [DING DOT](#placeholder-link) bot. The [DING DOT](#placeholder-link) bot is meant to help absolute beginners start writing Wechaty code without setting up their own development environment. You can run it on [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), [Google cloud shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell) or on your local machine. [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) and [Google cloud shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell) are both online [IDEs](#placeholder-link) that will get you running the DING DONG bot instantly.

## [Gitpod](#placeholder-link)

Gitpod is an online IDE which provides you with a complete development environment accompanied by a Visual-Studio-Code powered IDE and a cloud-based Linux container. You can navigate to the [Tutorials section](#placeholder-link) to run the Wechaty [getting-started repository](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started) on gitpod.

## [Google cloud shell](#placeholder-link)

Google cloud shell is also an online development and operations environment which is accessible anywhere with your browser. You can navigate to the [Tutorials section](#placeholder-link) to run the [getting-started repository](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started) on Google cloud shell instantly.

## [Local development environment](#placeholder-link)

You can also set up your own server for running the [getting-started repository](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started) on your machine instead of using the cloud-based IDE. There is a [beginner-friendly tutorial](#placeholder-link) in the [tutorials section](#placeholder-link) which will take you by the hand to help you run the [getting-started repository](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started) on your local machine.
