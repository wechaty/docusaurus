![Wechaty: Conversational RPA SDK for Chatbot Makers](/img/wechaty-logo.svg)

We have made it very easy to start writing Wechaty code in any of the supported programming languages. You need a few lines of code to turn your IM (such as [WeChat](https://www.wechat.com/), [Whatsapp](https://www.whatsapp.com/), [Wecom](https://work.weixin.qq.com/), [Lark](https://www.larksuite.com/zh_cn/), etc) account into a chatbot. Your chatbot will have conversations on behalf of you with Wechaty Conversational RPA technology.

We have set up a Wechaty [getting-started repository](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started) to help you start writing code in a couple of minutes. The Wechaty [getting-started repository](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started) contains code for a bot which we refer to as the [DING DONG](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started/blob/master/examples/ding-dong-bot.js) bot. The DING DOT bot is meant to help absolute beginners start writing Wechaty code without setting up their own development environment. You can run it on [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), [Google cloud shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell) or on your local machine. [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) and [Google cloud shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell) are both online [IDEs](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/middleware/what-is-ide) that will get you running the DING DONG bot instantly.

## Gitpod

Gitpod is an online IDE which provides you with a complete development environment accompanied by a Visual-Studio-Code powered IDE and a cloud-based Linux container. You can navigate to the [Tutorials section](quick-start/running-on-gitpod.md) to run the Wechaty [getting-started repository](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started) on gitpod.

## Google cloud shell

Google cloud shell is also an online development and operations environment which is accessible anywhere with your browser. You can navigate to the [Tutorials section](quick-start/running-on-google-cloud-shell.md) to run the [getting-started repository](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started) on Google cloud shell instantly.

## Local development environment

You can also set up your own server for running the [getting-started repository](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started) on your machine instead of using the cloud-based IDE. There is a [beginner-friendly tutorial](getting-started/running-locally.mdx) in the [tutorials section](getting-started/overview.mdx) which will take you by the hand to help you run the getting-started repository on your local machine.
