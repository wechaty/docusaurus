## How the documentation is organized

Wechaty has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it's organized will help you know where to look for certain things:

- [Tutorials](tutorials/overview.md) take you by the hand through a series of steps to create a Chatbot application. Start here if you are new to Wechaty or Chatbot application development. Also look at the "[First steps](#first-steps)".
- [Explainations](explainations/overview.mdx) discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
- [Reference guides](references/overview.mdx) contain technical reference for APIs and other aspects of Wechaty's machinery. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
- [How-to guides](howto/overview.mdx) are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Wechaty works.
