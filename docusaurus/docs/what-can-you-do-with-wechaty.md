## A brief history of Wechaty

Back in 2014, Wechaty creator [Huan Li](https://github.com/huan)'s daily life depended too much on Wechat, which was dubbed as China's famous messaging app that is capable of payment processing and other mini applications such as friendship management. Also at the time, adding friends in Wechat is possible but restricts a total number of friends to 5,000 only. Not to mention, the app has more than 400 rooms with more than 400 members each, and room management poses a big challenge. Aside from these issues, Wechat does not offer any tool or service for businesses to manage their customers which is essential for any business to thrive in China. In China, Wechat seems to be the nation's internet and it is crucial for businesses to grow their yield and to communicate with their customers who live their lives on Wechat.

Thus, Huan decided to build Wechaty and landed its first set of clients in 2016. After that, Wechaty Co-creator [Rui Li](https://github.com/lijiarui) found that Wechaty can help companies build relationships with their customers. Then, she used Wechaty to create [JuziBot](https://juzi.bot/) as a **customer management tool** that helps companies deal with business challenges such as acquiring, engaging, and retaining customers.
