## What is Wechaty's story

Back in 2014, Wechaty creator Huan Li's daily life depended too much on Wechat, which was dubbed as China's famous messaging app that is capable of payment processing and other mini applications such as friendship management. Also at the time, adding friends in Wechat is possible but restricts a total number of friends to 5,000 only. Not to mention, the app has more than 400 rooms with more than 400 members each, and room management poses a big challenge. Aside from these issues, Wechat does not offer any tool or service for businesses to manage their customers which is essential for any business to thrive in China. In China, Wechat is the nation's internet and it is crucial for businesses to grow their yield and to communicate with their customers who live their lives on Wechat.

Thus, Huan decided to build Wechaty and landed its first set of [clients](https://github.com/nibble0101/wechaty-documentation-draft/blob/main/01-introduction/04-who-is-using-wechaty.md) in 2017. Wechaty's chatbot can also function as a **_customer management tool_** that helps companies deal with some business challenges such as acquiring, engaging, and retaining customers. Wechaty is built as the _tireless bot_ that can work 24/7, can filter the most important messages, can highlight discussions that contain the **keywords** that users would want to search and follow, and can monitor chatbot and user actions seamlessly.

## Motivation

Wechaty aims to focus more on what the business is about instead of the code itself, despite the complicated requirements for conversational applications. As a chatbot framework for business, Wechaty is a last mile technology that brings chatbots to all types of end users.

## Mission

Wechaty's mission is to make it easy for developers and non-technical users to build their own chatbots.
