## Intro

Wechaty is a Node.js library for building chatbots that work on WeChat, WhatsApp, and other messaging platforms. With Wechaty, you can build intelligent chatbots that automate tasks, engage with customers, and provide a personalized experience for your users.

With the help of wechaty, you can build chatbots with 6 lines of code.

### Install

In most cases, you should install ```wechaty``` only. The package ```wechaty``` has ```wechaty-puppet```, ```wechaty-puppet-service``` in its dependencies, so you don't have install them by yourself. So all you have to is

```bash
npm install wechaty
```

If you wish to use a particular version of ```wechaty-puppet``` or ```wechaty-puppet-service```, you can install such package manually.

### Run

```ts
import { WechatyBuilder } from 'wechaty'

async function main () {
  const bot = new WechatyBuilder.build()
  bot
    .on('scan', (qrcode, status) => console.log(`Scan QR Code to login: ${status}\nhttps://wechaty.js.org/qrcode/${encodeURIComponent(qrcode)}`))
    .on('login',            user => console.log(`User ${user} logged in`))
    .on('message',       message => console.log(`Message: ${message}`))
  await bot.start()
}
```
