### [Project #44: Develop a WeChat chatbot for building simple personal knowledge base](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-wechaty/issues/44)

The project goal is to develop a WeChat chatbot which can help build simple personal knowledge base. It should be able to perform two kinds of automated tasks:

- once receiving a post share, save the post title and link to your database
- once receiving a text message, provide a list of posts related to the text

For example, if you share this post ([股票股市新手入门指南（完整版）](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/108627613)) to the chatbot from zhihu(知乎) app, it will save this post and notify you of the result. You will receive a list containing this post next time you send the chatbot a text message "股票". Your backend server should be able to calculate the semantic similarity between message texts and posts.

### [Project #46: Wechat group-society](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-wechaty/issues/46)

We would like to invite you to help us create a new way of socializing on wechat where individuals and groups can easily find like-minded people/groups by subscribing to our group-society official account.

We will build up a centralized platform using our powerful [wechaty official account puppet](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet-official-account) to allow individual users as well as wechat groups to subscribe to. With group users' permission, we will use our wechaty bot to collect chat messages, and analyze the topics of interest for each group via [topic modeling tools](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/). The top topics of each group will be used as its 'tag' so that individual users can search for and join the groups of interest. Besides, our wechaty bot can break the boundaries between groups of similar interests by sharing messages across groups.

### [Project #47: github webhook transformer/deligator for IM](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-wechaty/issues/47)

The project's goal is create a github webhooks' transformer, after the transformation, it can make the content of those webhooks more suitable for displayed on the various IMs(wechat, facebook, whatsapp). It would be better to create a deligated hook transform service using Wechaty which can broadcast those webhook events to IM directly.

#### Background

Github has a fantastic and strong webhook system allows you build or set up integrations easily. It can be used to trigger a CI build or update a deploy on production server, it is called workflow automation. And we can not only apply webhooks to automation, if we can easily broadcast these project events (pushes, prs, issues etc.) to various channels(wechat, facebook, whatsapp), it will be very conducive to people to discuss, comment and share. As it happens, Wechaty is one such product with a lot of puppeteers support many IMs which can help people create a chat bot in an easy way.

### [Project #50: path analysis of conversation graphs](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-wechaty/issues/50)

for improving the quality of chatbots it would be great to have some analysis of conversation logs. basically plotting "routes" through the conversation.

this really needs to be connected to backend NLP, so that we can reduce down the inputs to common intents. otherwise there are just too many individual variations of patterns

so the proposal would be to see some type of "path analysis" of a conversation graph ideally we could plot this against the ideal path for comparison

if we were to use a graph database to store the conversations perhaps we could do deeper analysis for things like the "optimum route" between two nodes. or visualizing the paths for an easier way to understand them.

I have a couple of projects here that were early tests in this direction that I can share the repos of. they aren't really using graph analysis yet they are more plotting conversations as visual graphs using D3 or Cytoscape. This project would be ideally about taking this to a next level of investigation.

It should be language agnostic - we would be working with tokens of intents and creating conversation graphs that link these intents together

### [Project #51: reinforcement learning as a method to design conversations](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-wechaty/issues/51)

We can try to plan a perfect path through a conversation ahead of time, and write out a script for our bots. This is "top down design"

But often the user will run the conversation in a completely different way. If they were talking to a real human agent, the conversation would flow in a different sequence.

Some authoring system such as rasa will start with this approach:
<https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/writing-stories>

But then try to use annotations of actual conversations to refine the conversation flow.
However, the current tools on the market really are quite un-unsable for this. RASA stories IMHO qucikly devolve to a huge mess that is impossible to view or reason about.

So this project would be a new start in trying to combine NLU conversation insights from "human in the loop" choices, or post-review of past conversations, with the top-down designed stories. The choices a human makes should affect future conversations in a probabalistic way

a simple prototype exists here, but it is not connected to any kind of NN model

### [Project #52: connect chat adventure game engine to Wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-wechaty/issues/52)

I wrote a game engine to deliver story like adventure games in a chat system. It was initially written for slack and Discord.

It would be interesting to port this to support WeChat. That would allow people to play group "adventure games" in a chat session.

The engine uses a script format to describe the stories <https://github.com/dcsan/storydata>

It has concepts for: rooms, actors, items, and inventory (things uses carry around)

all matching for sentences is done using Regex so we won't have the problems of systems like rivescript which uses a simplified regex pattern that doesn't work well for non-space languages like Chinese (or japanese)

The main runtime engine is all written in typescript.

currently there is a "PAL" class - Platform Abstraction Layer- that already has adapters for Slack and Discord APIs. This project would mainly be to adapt this to wechaty input/output API for delivering games into groups

You can play some of the games built with this on Discord, but this maybe hard inside the GFW. <https://ten.rik.ai/asylum/>

of course discord and slack have many features wechat does not, such as buttons or "clickable emoji reactions" so the adapter would have to deal with things like a "collector" or different ways to present menus. Wechat's main feature is that it's usable inside China.

Eventually we could make a web based editor for adding new stories, that would allow something like "fan fiction" stories to be created.

play BoPO game on discord here (direct link to our server) <https://discord.com/invite/Qgup6qU>

a bit more info/writeup <https://dc.rik.ai/projects/ten>

this type of engine could be used to deliver language learning games over wechat too. that was the original idea for this project: <https://dc.rik.ai/projects/comic-english>

### [Project #53: create "mind map" authoring tool for simple wechaty bots](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-wechaty/issues/53)

A large number of bots can be very simple decision trees, using some type of regex parser on the responses. But building these bots is still very time consuming.

We propose using a "mind map" visual editor to create simple bots.
Many open source libraries exist for editing mind maps
This tool would then use that map data as a conversation structure for people to interact with bots.

The first version would be purely for text based input and output
the mind map format could be seen as a simple outliner view:

```txt
- bot: what's your favorite color?
  - user: blue
    - bot: the sky is blue!
  - user: red
    - bot: red is dynamic
```

While this is only useful for simple bots, the ease of use and accessibility for building out quick and simple bots fits the "80:20" pareto principle.

some mindmap tools here: <https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/mindmap>

So the parts of this project would be:

- visual editor (react? vue?)
- generates structured conversation syntax
- runtime to accept responses from wechaty adapter, maintain conversation session and reply

### [Project #54: Implement "Slack" Puppet](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-wechaty/issues/54)

Since the Wechaty is a universal messaging SDK. I believe we can implement this with Slack, but not only on Slack.

The Slack and Wechat message may be able to sync the messages. So while there is more open idea we can integrate. I think this would be good project for summer

### [Project #55: Implement CLI control wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-wechaty/issues/55)

Web GUI is great, but not great enough if we just want to have a terminal while we are doing the implementation testing, If we can have a CLI tool to control the bot and CLI likely GUI to have a display dashboard to relate control(like tmux). That will be great.

I believe there is a more open ideas we can integrate. I think this would be a good project for summer

### [Project #59: Improve matrix-appservice-wechaty user info](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-wechaty/issues/59)

`matrix-appservice-wechaty` is a WeChat (微信) Matrix AppService for bridging the Matrix user with WeChat user.

According to [Types of Bridging](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/types-of-bridging), Wechaty Bot in Matrix will create an [Simple Puppeted Bridge](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/types-of-bridging#simple-puppeted-bridge) with [Portal Rooms](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/types-of-bridging#portal-rooms) because we want to bring all conversations from Wechat to Matrix, and let the Matrix user control his account on Wechat.

We want to improve this module and make it better, including but not limited to the following new features / fixes:

1. Appservice doesn't show the user name and user avatar in group chat. Now we need to show the correct user name and avatar in group chat. And show the user avatar in the direct message.
1. Appservice can not send files to wechat users. Now we make appservice send files and pictures to wechat users.
1. Appservice can not display wechat bbob message directly. We need to convert bbob message to HTML and return it to the matrix server.

### [Project #63: Wechaty Todo List](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-wechaty/issues/67)

We often need to install various apps in our mobile phones to complete different tasks, so I hope to use wechaty to do a task management function, which can complete the whole operation through wechaty.

Preliminary design:

1. Wechaty allows you to add to-do items
2. Inform the user in advance when the to-do is about to end
3. When the to-do has been completed, send the status change information to finish the current task
4. Monthly statistics of the current month, the total number of to-do items,the total number of completed, unfinished, to be completed
