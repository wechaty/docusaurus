This section covers the main Wechaty concepts you need to be familiar with to understand the other sections of the documentation. The other sections of the documentation assume you are familiar with the following concepts:

- **Bot**

  A bot is a software application that is programmed to perform specific tasks. Bots usually imitate human behavior and perform certain repetitive tasks faster. Bots are automated therefore do not need to be started manually by a human being.

- **Chatbot**

  These are bots which are designed for interacting with humans in voice or text-based conversation. Chatbots simulate human conversation by responding to certain phrases or words with programmed responses. Wechaty is a software program for developing chatbots for Instant Messaging services such as Wechat and Whatsapp. You can check our [Introduction section](#placeholder-link) for a list of all the supported Instant Messaging systems.

- **Wechaty Puppet**

  Wechaty Puppet is a standard for maintaining compatibility between Instant Messaging(IM) systems. Wechaty Puppet defines the universal Instant Messaging interface for compatibility between Wechaty API and variants of IM systems.

- **Puppet provider**

  Wechaty puppet provider refers to [RPA](#placeholder-link) module used for connecting Wechaty API to the corresponding Instant Messaging platform bot account. Each supported Instant Messaging system has its Puppet provider. See [Puppet Providers](#placeholder-link) section for a complete list of puppet providers.

- **Puppet service provider**

  Puppet service providers refer to Wechaty developers who have developed puppets for the different Instant Messaging systems.

- **Wechaty service token**

  This is a unique key for authorizing Wechaty puppet service access. This token is issued by Puppet service providers.

- **Robotic process automation**

  Robotic process automation (RPA) refers to technology that allows users to configure software robots to execute business processes and automate repetitive tasks across applications and systems without human intervention.

- **Software Development Kit**

  Software development kit (SDK) is a toolkit used by developers to create applications for a specific platform, operating system or device. A great example would be **Wechaty**, wherein it is called a **_conversational RPA SDK_** that is used by developers to create customized chatbots.
