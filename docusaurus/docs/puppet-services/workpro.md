## Frequently asked questions

- 14 UNAVAILABLE: No connection established

  This is often caused by TLS setting problem. You have to disable TLS to use WorkPro token. You can do this with code or environment variables.

  - Code: add ```tls: {disable: true}``` into puppetOptions.
  - Env: WECHATY_PUPPET_SERVICE_NO_TLS_INSECURE_CLIENT=true

- Cannot find token

  When you get your token, you'll also get the discovery service address of the token. (If not, please contact customer service.) If the address is not ```api.chatie.com```, then you have to set an environment variable to explicitly set it. You can do this by adding this to your environment variable list.

  - Env: WECHATY_PUPPET_SERVICE_AUTHORITY={DISCOVER_ADDRESS} (Address is usually token-service-discovery-test.juzibot.com)
