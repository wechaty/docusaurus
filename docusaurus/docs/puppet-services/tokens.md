## What is Wechaty Puppet Service Token?

TOKEN is a unique string for authorizing Wechaty Puppet Service.

## Examples

1. **WXWork TOKEN** : `puppet_wxwork_7ce4cf8a1ab789166c39c6`
2. **PadLocal TOKEN** : `puppet_padlocal_7ce48a1ab789166c39c6`

5. **UUIDv4 TOKEN** : `56945fa4-7ce8-4cf8-a1a9-b789166c39c6`

When you are using a Wechaty Puppet Service, you need to provide TOKEN to it so that it can serve you correctly.
