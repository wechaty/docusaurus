## Integration

Let's take up an example on how to integrate bot from [starter templete](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started) to WeChat Offical Account. The step is similar for all other bots as well.

### Prerequisite

1. Offical Wechaty package: [package/wechaty](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wechaty).
2. Address of the service provider that supports HTTP and HTTPS such as 80, 443. Several internet penetration tools: [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/).
3. Permanent external network address: [ngrok](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok).

You can follow up the steps mentioned below:

1. Initialize the project by creating a new folder `my-bot`.

```bash
mkdir my-bot
cd my-bot
```

2. Install the dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
npm install wechaty
```

3. Develop temporary internet address as follows:

```bash
npm install -g localtunnel lt â€“port 80
```

4. Add the dependencies for using the bot with WeChat Offical Account:

```bash
npm install wechaty-puppet-official-account
```

5. Create a new folder `src` and add a file `my-bot.js`. Add any of the functions from <a href="#"> add functionality to the bot</a> section to the snippet below:

```bash
const {
  Contact,
  Message,
  ScanStatus,
  Wechaty,
  log,
}= require('wechaty')
console.log(welcome)
const bot = new Wechaty()
/*
 *Your function goes here
 */
```

6. Configure your `appId`, `appSecret`, `token`, `port` as follows:

```bash
const bot = new Wechaty({
    name: '<your bot name>',
  puppet: new PuppetOA({
    appId: "wxbd801c28fbe1bbbd",
    appSecret: "6959408a3ba1c82db1a11d941df65764",
    token: "token",
    port: 80
  })
})
```

7. After you are done with the file, you can run the bot using the following commands:

```bash
export WECHATY_LOG=verbose
export WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-official-account
node src/my-bot.js
```
Now, you are ready to play with the bot!

You can deploy the bot with popular container solutions as well such as:

* [Deploy with Heroku](#a)
* [Deploy with Docker](#b)
