## Integration

Let's take up an example on how to integrate bot from [starter templete](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started) to WeChat4U. The step is similar for all other bots as well.

### Prerequisite

1. Official Wechaty package: [package/wechaty](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wechaty).
2. QRCode terminal edition: [package/qrcode-terminal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode-terminal).

You can follow up the steps mentioned below:

1. Initialize the project by creating a new folder `my-bot`:

```ts
mkdir my-bot
cd my-bot
```

2. Install the dependencies using the following commands:

```ts
npm install wechaty
npm install qrcode-terminal
```

3. Install the puppet using the following commands:

```ts
npm install --save wechat4u@latest
npm install wechaty-puppet-wechat4u
```

4. Create a new folder `src` and add a file `my-bot.js`. Add any of the functions from <a href="#"> add functionality to the bot</a> section to the snippet below:

```ts
import { Wechat } from 'wechat4u'
import {
  Contact,
  Message,
  ScanStatus,
  Wechaty,
  log,
} from 'wechaty'

import { qrTerm } from 'qrcode-terminal'

console.log(welcome)
const bot = new Wechaty()
// or use the core API
// import { WechatCore } from 'wechat4u/lib/core'
/*
 *Your function goes here
 */
```

5. After you are done with the file, you can run the bot using the following commands:

```ts
export WECHATY_LOG=verbose
export WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-wechat4u
node src/my-bot.js
```

Now, you are ready to play with the bot!

You can deploy the bot with popular container solutions as well such as:

* [Deploy with Heroku](#a)
* [Deploy with Docker](#b)
