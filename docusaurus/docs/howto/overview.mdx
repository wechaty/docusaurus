<!-- ## Using Puppets with Wechaty (How to switch between puppets) -->

<!-- For different instant messaging (IM) systems (such as WeChat, Whatsapp, and TikTok), the Wechaty community builds separate RPA (Robotic Process Automation) modules for each, and we call those modules [Wechaty Puppet](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet). -->

<!-- Wechaty Puppet Service is gRPC for Wechaty Puppet. To use a Wechaty Puppet Service, you need a TOKEN for that service, and pass it to Wechaty, then you will be able to use that Puppet Service. -->

<!-- ```sh -->
<!-- export WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-service -->
<!-- export WECHATY_PUPPET_SERVICE_TOKEN="__TOKEN__" -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- > You can switch between different Wechaty Puppet Services by changing your TOKEN. The source code works same irrespective of the token you used. -->

<!-- To learn how to generate TOKEN and switch between puppets , you can visit [Puppet Services](https://wechaty.js.org/docs/puppet-services/). -->

<!-- ## Use Cases -->

<!-- You can learn more from [Wechaty cases study](case-study/overview.md) -->
