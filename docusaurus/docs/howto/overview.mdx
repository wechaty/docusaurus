<!-- how-to/cookbook - Explains how to accomplish a specific task. -->

How-to guides are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Wechaty works.

These are some use cases and code snippets to get you started with Redux in a real app. They assume you understand the topics in [basic](#b) and [advanced](#a) tutorials.

## Using Puppets with Wechaty (How to switch between puppets)

For different instant messaging (IM) systems (such as WeChat, Whatsapp, and TikTok), the Wechaty community builds separate RPA (Robotic Process Automation) modules for each, and we call those modules [Wechaty Puppet](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet).

Wechaty Puppet Service is gRPC for Wechaty Puppet. To use a Wechaty Puppet Service, you need a TOKEN for that service, and pass it to Wechaty, then you will be able to use that Puppet Service.

```sh
export WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-service
export WECHATY_PUPPET_SERVICE_TOKEN="__TOKEN__"
```

> You can switch between different Wechaty Puppet Services by changing your TOKEN. The source code works same irrespective of the token you used.

To learn how to generate TOKEN and switch between puppets , you can visit [Puppet Services](https://wechaty.js.org/docs/puppet-services/).

## Use Cases
