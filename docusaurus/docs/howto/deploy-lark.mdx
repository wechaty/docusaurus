## Requirements

1. Your system must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) installed (version >= 12).
2. Your system must have [Wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty) (version >= 0.40).
3. You must be familiar with [wechaty-puppet-lark](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wechaty-puppet-lark).

## Deployment

Run `wechaty-puppet-lark`:

<!-- MDX import -->
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

<Tabs
  groupId="operating-systems"
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    { label: 'Linux',   value: 'linux', },
    { label: 'macOS',   value: 'mac', },
    { label: 'Windows', value: 'windows', },
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="linux">

```sh
npm install wechaty-puppet-lark
export WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-lark
npm start
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac">

```sh
npm install wechaty-puppet-lark
export WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-lark
npm start
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">

```sh
npm install wechaty-puppet-lark
set WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-lark
npm start
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Integration

Let's take up an example on how to integrate bot from [starter templete](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-getting-started) to Lark. The step is similar for all other bots as well.

### Prerequisite

1. Offical Wechaty package: [package/wechaty](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wechaty).
2. Configure your system environment variables as below:

* `WECHATY_PUPPET_LARK_APPID`: for the app ID of Feishu application.
* `WECHATY_PUPPET_LARK_APPSECRET`: for the app secret of Feishu App.
* `WECHATY_PUPPET_LARK_TOKEN`: for the verification token provided by Feishu Event Subscription Platform.

You can follow up the steps mentioned below:

1. Initialize the project by creating a new folder `my-bot`:

```bash
mkdir my-bot
cd my-bot
```

2. Install the dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
npm install wechaty
```

3. Add the dependencies for using the bot with Lark:

```bash
npm install wechaty-puppet-lark
```

4. Create a new folder `src` and add a file `my-bot.js`. Add any of the functions from <a href="#"> add functionality to the bot</a> section to the snippet below:

```bash
const {
  Contact,
  Message,
  ScanStatus,
  Wechaty,
  log,
}= require('wechaty')

console.log(welcome)
const bot = new Wechaty()

/*
 *Your function goes here
 */
```

5. Obtain your functional permissions on Feishu platform from [Feishu Open Platform-Application Permission](https://open.feishu.cn/document/ukTMukTMukTM/uQjN3QjL0YzN04CN2cDN).

6. After you are done with the file, you can run the bot using the following commands:

```bash
export WECHATY_LOG=verbose
export WECHATY_PUPPET=wechaty-puppet-lark
node src/my-bot.js
```

Copy the generated code to Lark and you are ready to play with the bot!

You can deploy the bot with popular container solutions as well such as:

* [Deploy with Heroku](#a)
* [Deploy with Docker](#b)
