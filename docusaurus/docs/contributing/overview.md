title: Contributing to Wechaty
---

Wechaty is a community that lives on its volunteers. As it keeps growing, we
always need more people to help others. You can contribute in many ways, either
on the framework itself or in the wider ecosystem.

## Work on the Wechaty framework

The work on Wechaty itself falls into three major areas:

### Writing code 💻

Fix a bug, or add a new feature. You can make a pull request and see **your
code** in the next version of Wechaty!

Start from the [writing code docs](writing-code.md).

### Writing documentation ✍️

Wechaty's documentation is one of its key strengths. It's informative
and thorough. You can help to improve the documentation and keep it
relevant as the framework evolves.

See [writing documentation](writing-documentation.md) for more.

### Building RPA Puppet Provider/Service 🗺️

Wechaty supports over 10 Puppet Provider & Services.
The RPA team are always looking for hackers
to help maintain and increase IMs that Wechaty ecosystem should support.

See [creating your puppet providers](puppet-providers/diy.md)
to help expand the RPA for Wechaty.

If you think working *with* Wechaty is fun, wait until you start working *on*
it. Really, **ANYONE** can do something to help make Wechaty better and greater!

## Join the Wechaty community ❤️

We're passionate about helping Wechaty users make the jump to contributing
members of the community. There are several other ways you can help the
Wechaty community and others to maintain a great ecosystem to work in:

- Join the [Wechaty channel](https://gitter.im/wechaty/wechaty)
  on Gitter.im and answer questions.
  By explaining Wechaty to other users, you're going to learn a lot about the
  framework yourself.

- Join the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/discussions).
  This forum is a place for discussing the Wechaty
  framework and applications and projects that use it. This is also a good
  place to ask and answer any questions related to installing, using, or
  contributing to Wechaty.

- Join the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/wechaty) and answer questions.

- Blog about Wechaty. We syndicate all the Wechaty blogs we know about on
  the [community blogs](https://wechaty.js.org/blog);
  if you'd like to see your blog on that page you can [register it here](publish-blog.md).

- Contribute to open-source Wechaty projects, write some documentation, or
  release your own code as an open-source pluggable application. The
  ecosystem of pluggable applications is a big strength of Wechaty, help us
  build it!

We're looking forward to working with you. Welcome aboard! ⛵️
