## Guidelines for Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Wechaty.

This post explains the process of contributing to the Wechaty project.

Wechaty is an open source software which is highly relied on volunteers to maintain. As we keep growing, we always welcome more people to join us. Please read through and abide by [Wechaty Community Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

### Why should you contribute?

As an open source organization with a useful and viable product, Wechaty thrives on the contributions of the community members. Regardless of your skill set, there are numerous things that you can do to help make Wechaty better, so start forking!

### Not sure where to start?

It is a myth that writing code is the only way to contribute to open source. The Wechaty community is very open to new ideas and there are so many different ways to make valuable contributions. We even have some ideas on how you can get started!

## Work on the Wechaty framework

The work on Wechaty itself falls into three (3) major areas:

### Writing code üíª

Fix a bug, or add a new feature. You can make a pull request and see **your
code** in the next version of Wechaty!

- Check out the GitHub issues with the tags `good first issue`, `pull request welcome`, or `help wanted`
- Write code examples for documentation
- Report bugs and work on resolving it
- Collaborate with others on building new features
- Suggest enhancements and request features as GitHub issues

Start from the [writing code docs](coding.md).

### Writing documentation ‚úçÔ∏è

Documentation is one of the most important things that introduce Wechaty to general users. If you like teaching and sharing knowledge with other people, you are more than welcome to join our documentation project. Below are some ways you could contribute:

- Fix typos in the documentation
- Translate documentation to your local language
- Write tutorials and blog posts, refer to <https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org/tree/master/jekyll/_posts>
- Answer questions on the Wechaty Developers Home or GitHub issues
- Organize Wechaty meetups or user groups in your area

For more information, you may contact wechaty@googlegroups.com.

See [writing documentation](documentation.md) for more tips.

### Building RPA Puppet Provider/Service üó∫Ô∏è

Wechaty supports over ten (10) Puppet Providers & Services.
The RPA team is always looking for hackers
to help maintain and increase the IMs that the Wechaty ecosystem should support.

See [creating your puppet providers](../puppet-providers/diy.md)
to help expand the RPA for Wechaty.

**Tips:**
If you want to add new features or change the API, please submit an **issue** first to make sure no one else is already working on the same issue. Discuss the implementation and API details with the maintainers and users by creating an issue. When everything is settled down, you may submit a **pull request**.

Make sure to add **tests** for your features and bug fixes, and update the documentation (see below) before submitting your code!

### Contribute Support üëê

If you spot something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/wechaty/openapi/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

- Fix typos in the documentation
- Translate documentation to your local language
- Write tutorials and blog posts, refer to <https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org/tree/master/jekyll/_posts>
- Answer questions on the Wechaty Developers Home or GitHub issues
- Organize Wechaty meetups or user groups in your area
- Another way of contributing can be by following and sharing Wechaty content across social media platforms like YouTube, Gitter, etc.

For more information, you may contact wechaty@googlegroups.com.

If you think _working with Wechaty_ is fun, wait until you start working on it. Apparently, **ANYONE** can do something to help make Wechaty better and greater!

### Ready to make a change? Fork the repo

**Fork using GitHub Desktop:**

- [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up the desktop.
- Once the desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

**Fork using the command line:**

- [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you are ready to merge them.

**Fork with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces):**

- [Fork, edit, and preview](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace) using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) without having to install and run the project locally.

#### Open a pull request

When you are done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review, use the **pull request template** to open your pull request (PR).

#### Submit your PR & get it reviewed

- Once you submit your PR, others from the Docs community will review it with you. The first thing you are going to want to do is a [self-review](#self-review).
- After that, we may have questions so always check your PR to keep up with the conversation.
- Did you have an issue such as a merge conflict? Check out our [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) on how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

#### Your PR is merged

Congratulations! The whole GitHub community is thankful for your help! :sparkles:

#### Suggested changes

We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork before committing them to your branch.

As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
