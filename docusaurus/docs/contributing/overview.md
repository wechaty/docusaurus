## Guidelines for Contributing

Thank you for your time on Wechaty.

This document explains the process of contributing to the Wechaty project.

First of all please follow the [Wechaty Community Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) in all your interactions within the project.

Wechaty is a community that lives on its volunteers. As it keeps growing, we always need more people to help others. You can contribute in many ways, either to the framework itself or in the wider ecosystem.

### Why contribute

As an open-source product, Wechaty thrives on the contributions of community members. Whatever your skill set is, there is a lot you can do to help us make Wechaty better!
So start forking!

### Not sure where to start?

It's a myth that writing code is the only way to contribute to open source. Wechaty community is open to new ideas and there are so many different ways to make valuable contributions. We have some ideas of how you can get started!

## Work on the Wechaty framework

The work on Wechaty itself falls into three major areas:

### Writing code üíª

Fix a bug, or add a new feature. You can make a pull request and see **your
code** in the next version of Wechaty!

- Check out GitHub issues with the tags `good first issue`, `pull request welcome`, or `help wanted`
- Write code examples for documentation
- Report a bug and work on resolving it
- Collaborate with others on building new features

Start from the [writing code docs](coding.md).

### Writing documentation ‚úçÔ∏è

What's documentation is one of its key strengths? It's informative
and thorough. You can help to improve the documentation and keep it
relevant as the framework evolves.

- Fix typos in documentation
- Translate documentation to your local language
- Write tutorials and blog posts, see more: <https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org/tree/master/jekyll/_posts>
- Answer questions on the Wechaty Developers Home or Github issues
- Organize Wechaty meetups or user groups in your area

Contact rui@Wechaty.io to learn more

See [writing documentation](documentation.md) for more.

### Building RPA Puppet Provider/Service üó∫Ô∏è

Wechaty supports over 10 Puppet Providers & Services.
The RPA team is always looking for hackers
to help maintain and increase IMs that the Wechaty ecosystem should support.

See [creating your puppet providers](../puppet-providers/diy.md)
to help expand the RPA for Wechaty.

**Tips:**
If you want to add new features or change the API, please submit an issue first to make sure no one else is already working on the same thing and discuss the implementation and API details with maintainers and users by creating an issue. When everything is settled down, you can submit a pull request.

Make sure to add tests for your features and bug fixes and update the documentation (see below) before submitting your code!

### Contribute Support

If you spot something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/wechaty/openapi/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

- Fix typos in documentation
- Translate documentation to your local language
- Write tutorials and blog posts, see more: https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org/tree/master/jekyll/_posts
- Answer questions on the Wechaty Developers Home or Github issues
- Organize Wechaty meetups or user groups in your area

Contact rui@Wechaty.io to learn more

### Ready to make a change? Fork the repo

Fork using GitHub Desktop:

- [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
- Once the Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

Fork using the command line:

- [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

Fork with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces):

- [Fork, edit, and preview](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace) using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) without having to install and run the project locally.

#### Open a pull request

When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review, use the pull request template to open your PR (pull request).

#### Submit your PR & get it reviewed

- Once you submit your PR, others from the Docs community will review it with you. The first thing you're going to want to do is a [self-review](#self-review).
- After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.
- Did you have an issue, like a merge conflict? Check out our [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) on how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

#### Your PR is merged

Congratulations! The whole GitHub community thanks you. :sparkles:

#### Suggested changes

We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).

## Join the Wechaty community ‚ù§Ô∏è
