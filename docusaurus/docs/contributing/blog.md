## Tricks

### Hide A Post

If you do not want to list your post on the website,
you can add a `published: false` to the front matter YAML.

```yaml
published: false
```

### List on <https://wechaty.js.org/news/>

If a post has a tag named `news`
then it will be shown at <https://wechaty.js.org/news/>

```yaml
tags:
  - news
```

All posts will be showed at <https://wechaty.js.org/blog/>

### Show Big Picture

```yaml
tags:
  - sticky
```

## Minimizing images

Optimize image compression where possible.

Our limitation for an image is:

1. file size maximum 1MB
1. file resolution maximum 1920x1080

For image files, use `scripts/fit-image.sh`:

```sh
./scripts/fit-image.sh jekyll/assets/2021/03-your-blog-folder/
```

This is based on ImageMagick.
