> What is [Value Proposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_proposition)?
  A value proposition is a statement that
  answers the 'why' someone should do business with you.
  It should convince a potential customer
  why your service or product will be of more value to them
  than similar offerings from your competition.

The phrase(term) "value proposition" was first used in the paper [A Business is a Value Delivery System, Michael Lanning and Edward Michaels, 1988](http://www.dpvgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/1988-A-Business-is-a-VDS-McK-Staff-Ppr.pdf) for the consulting firm McKinsey.

## Why Value Proposition is Important

The _Value Proposition_ is a statement that answers the ‘why’ someone should do business with you.

It should convince a potential customer why your service or product will be of more value to them than similar offerings from your competition.

You know why your company is great, but do your potential customers know what sets your brand apart?

it must tell your audience:

1. How your product or service solves/improves problems
1. What benefits customers can expect
1. Why customers should buy from you over your competitors

It introduces you to prospective buyers and helps you make a strong first impression. That's why it is so important to have a powerful one.

## Guidelines

Your value proposition needs to be specific, and address the problems that you can help your customers solve.

1. Identify all the benefits your product offers.
1. Describe what makes these benefits valuable.
1. Identify your customer's main problem.
1. Connect this value to your buyer's problem.
1. Differentiate yourself as the preferred provider of this value.

It should be clear and concise. Anything too long will lose your readers.

In a nutshell, a value proposition is a clear statement that offers three things:

1. Relevancy. Explain how your product solves customers’ problems or improves their situation.
1. Quantified value. Deliver specific benefits.
1. Differentiation. Tell the ideal customer why they should buy from you and not from the competition.

## Template

The value proposition is usually a block of text (a headline, sub-headline, and one paragraph of text) with a visual (photo, hero image, graphics).

There is no one right way to go about it. We suggest you start with the following formula:

1. Headline. What is the end-benefit you’re offering in one short sentence? It can mention the product and/or customer. Make it an attention grabber.
1. Sub-headline or a 2–3 sentence paragraph. A specific explanation of what you do/offer, for whom, and why it’s useful.
1. 3 bullet points. List the key benefits or features.
1. Visual. Images communicate much faster than words. Show the product image, the hero shot, or an image reinforcing your main message.

## Evaluate

Evaluate your current value proposition by checking whether it answers the questions below:

1. What product or service is your company selling?
1. What is the end-benefit of using it?
1. Who is your target customer for this product or service?
1. What makes your offering unique and different?

Use the headline/paragraph/bullets/visual formula to structure the answers.

## About Wechaty Landing Page

The Wechaty landing page <https://wechaty.js.org> has been created with the default [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/) template.

It's clean but has too few information about the value proposition, and we want to improve it.

The plan is to add more information to our landing pages, so that it will can deliver the value propositions like the examples above. (Strip, MailChimp, Lyft, etc.)

## The Reconstructing Plan

I have drafted a list of the value proposation in our [Wechaty Meeting Notes](https://bit.ly/3tmsN3j) and will continue improving it over there.

Currently, I believe we have the following points can be showed on our landing page:

Besides the above list, we still need our **value proposition** to be added.

## This is a Wechaty GSoD'21 project

That's the reason why I want to add this docs page reconstructing project to our Wechaty GSoD'21. Please feel free to let me know what you think, and proposal for this project will be welcome!

### The project’s problem

Most of our new users come to Wechaty website by landing on our homepage at <https://wechaty.js.org>. Unfortunately, the landing page is too simple and leak of enough information for new users, especially no valua proposition. This problem leads to us losing lots of new users, or make new users take more time to understanding what Wechaty can do and why we are the best.

We need to improve the homepage (landing page) on our website with value propositions.

### The project’s scope

Homepage (landing page) is the first look when a new user comes to our community. We need to make them to understanding what Wechaty can do and why we are the best.

    1. How your product or service solves/improves problems
    1. What benefits customers can expect
    1. Why customers should buy from you over your competitors
1. The value proposition needs to be specific, and address the problems that you can help your customers solve.

    1. Differentiation. Tell the ideal customer why they should buy from you and not from the competition.
1. The value proposition should bex a block of text (a headline, sub-headline, and one paragraph of text) with a visual (photo, hero image, graphics).
    1. Headline. What is the end-benefit you’re offering in one short sentence? It can mention the product and/or customer. Make it an attention grabber.

    1. What is the end-benefit of using it?
    1. Who is your target user for this project?
    1. What makes your offering unique and different?
1. Work with the contributor team to update the documentation on the Wechaty site.

### What is out-of-scope for this project

1. This project is not for returns users: it's for new users who have never used Wechaty before.

We have committer candidates for mentoring our GSoD project,
and we estimate that this work will take three months to complete.
The creator of Wechaty [@huan](https://wechaty.js.org/contributors/huan)
(who is the creator of Wechaty)
have committed to supporting the project.

## Measuring your project’s success

As of today, homepage on our site receive 25% of the landing traffic,
57% of landing traffic is new,
Bounce-rate is 60%,
Pages/Session is 2,
Avg. Session Duration is 03:11.

We will track the above metrics (bounce rate, pages per session, and avg session duration)
monthly after the documentation is published.

We would consider the project successful if, after publication of the new homepage:

- The bounce rate of homepage decreased by 10% (<50%)
- The pages per session increases by 50% (>3)
- The avg session duration increased by 30% (> 4:00)
