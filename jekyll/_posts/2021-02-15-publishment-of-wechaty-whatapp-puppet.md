With the introduction of wechaty puppet and the growth of the wechaty ecosystem and community, we're happy to introduce `wechaty-puppet-whatsapp` which connects Wechaty API, the conversational RPA SDK for chatbot makers, and WhatsApp, a free, multi-platform messaging app.

As a developer, you can use `wechaty-puppet-whatsapp` to build your own WhatsApp chatbot with a few lines of code, which can send and receive WhatsApp messages with wechaty API.

- GitHub repo: <https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet-whatsapp>
- npm package: <https://npmjs.com/package/wechaty-puppet-whatsapp>

## Getting started

First, you should install the package.

```bash
npm i wechaty-puppet-whatsapp
npm i wechaty
```

To enable the display of QR code in the terminal, `qrcode-terminal` should also be installed.

```bash
npm i qrcode-terminal
```

Then, you can implement your bot in a few lines of code, here is an basic demo:

```javascript
const { Wechaty, log} = require("wechaty");
const qrterminal = require('qrcode-terminal');
const { PuppetWhatsapp} = require("wechaty-puppet-whatsapp");

const puppet  = new PuppetWhatsapp()
const bot = new Wechaty({ puppet })

bot
  .on('scan', qrcode => qrterminal.generate(qrcode, { small: true }))
  .on('login', user => log.info(`User ${user} logged in`))
  .on('message', message => log.info(`Message: ${message}`))

bot.start()
  .then(() => log.info('StarterBot', 'Starter Bot Started.'))
  .catch(e => log.error('StarterBot', e))
```

After scanning a WhatsApp QR code and logging in, you can view the received messages in the terminal, feel free to implement your own function over the messages based on your need.
