## 2020 Review

We have summurized what we did those fantastic improvements in 2020 into one number: 666!

Why 666? It's because we have got three sixes!

### 6 Lines of Code

Firstly, as we all know, Wechaty can build a chatbot with only 6 lines of JavaScript/TypeScript code!

And after 2020, we can not only write Wechaty chatbots in JavaScript/TypeScript, but also write them in almost any languages that you are using, for example, Python!

```python
bot = Wechaty()
bot.on('scan', lambda status, qrcode, data: print('Scan QR Code to login: {}\nhttps://wechaty.js.org/qrcode/{}'.format(status, qrcode)))
bot.on('login', lambda user: print('User {} logged in'.format(user)))
bot.on('message', lambda message: print('Message: {}'.format(message)))
await bot.start()
```

> The World's Shortest ChatBot Code: 6 lines of JavaScript

### 6 Programming Languages

Secondly, Wechaty can be used in 6 programming languages other than JavaScript/TypeScript, they are:

1. [Python Wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty/python-wechaty)
1. [Go Wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty/go-wechaty)
1. [Java Wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty/java-wechaty)
1. [Scala Wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty/scala-wechaty)
1. [PHP Wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty/php-wechaty)!
1. [.NET Wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty/dotnet-wechaty)

We drafted the [Multi-language Wechaty Issue #1927](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/discussions/1927) in March 2020, and our Wechaty community members are so great that we finished translate Wechaty from TypeScript to Python, Go, and Java in 2 months, and then we got another three (Scala, PHP, .NET) done in the next 3 months, it's so unbelievable!

And after 2020, we can not only connect Wechaty to WeChat, but also connect our chatbot to more IM platforms!

### 6 IM Platforms

Thirdly, Wechaty can connecting to 6 IM platforms other than WeChat, they are:

1. [Whatsapp](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet-whatsapp)
1. [TikTok](https://wechaty.js.org/2020/10/13/wechaty-puppet-douyin-final-term/)
1. [Lark](https://wechaty.js.org/2020/09/30/wechaty-puppet-lark-final-blog/)
1. [Kuaishou](https://wechaty.js.org/2020/10/13/wechaty-puppet-kuaishou-final-term/)
1. [Gitter](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet-gitter)
1. [WxWork](https://github.com/juzibot/wxwork-tester)

Most of those support (Whatsapp, TikTok, Lark, Kuaishou) are built by community developers who comes from the [Open Source Promotion Plan - Summer 2020](https://isrc.iscas.ac.cn/summer2020/). Summer 2020 is a Google Summer of Code like program co-organized by ISCAS & openEuler Community. Wechaty was recognized by the organizer as a valuable open-source project, we published a dozen oss tasks to student develoeprs who want to practice with the oss, and they are so great that everyone did a great job with us!

And after 2020, we can not only use Wechaty Puppet locally, but also we can cloudify the [Wechaty Pupppet as a Service (TBW)](https://wechaty.js.org/2021-01-02-wechaty-puppet-service)!

So, 2020 Wechaty 666!

## 2021 Outlook

For the coming 2021, we have a great conversation with all the friends at our dinner.

There will be more and more opptunities for Wechaty in 2021, we have picked four out of them which we believe they are the most important ones.

1. Globalization: Google Summer of Code
1. Book: Chatbot 1 to 2
1. More Puppet Service Providers
1. Five Years Celebration

### 1. Globalization

1. [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2021 will start soon, Wechaty should apply to join as a open-source organization, then connect to the global student developers through the GSoC in 2021. (We should also join Summer 2021 in China as well)
1. The Open Source Fundation is a great place to hold our Wechaty oss project. We should keep eyes on the top tier fundations and learn how to play with them. E.g., it would be very helpful for us if we can join Apache or Linux fundation.

### 2. Book & Documentation

1. The [Wechaty Docs Website](https://wechaty.js.org/docs/) is not clear for our developers, especially a developers never know Wechaty before. We should fill the contents in our docs in 2021.
1. We have a plan to write a book (code name [Chatbot 1 to 2](https://wechaty.github.io/chatbot-1-to-2/)) online, the target audience is a programmer who want to build a chatbot to solve their conversational user interface problem but has never heard about Wechaty,
to getting started with Wechaty and write good chatbot code.

### 3. More Puppet Service Providers

Currently we have only four [Wechaty Puppet Service Providers](https://wechaty.js.org/docs/puppet-services), and we should find more developers who is willing and able to build and provide the Wechaty Puppet Service. (at least increase another four providers)

### 4. Five Years Celebration

We have already [150 contributors](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XcDoIczyIclqXP1p90Sz7S0n4Q22xjFzJmjPFlU2g1E/edit) with Wechaty open-source project!

However, most of us are never meet in person before, so let's meet in 2021!

Our plan is to host a 5 Years Celebration in March 2021, please let us know what you think by discussing at <https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/discussions/categories/5-years-celebration>!
