Development Environment: I use macOS with a virtual box installed for working with other OS.

### About Me

I am a technical writing enthusiast and I always used to do the documentation part of any project my group was assigned (apart from the project of course!), I am also a past participant of Google Season of Docs’20. I am a Bachelor of Engineering undergrad pursuing Computer Science and Engineering from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University. I have a working proficiency in English. I am comfortable with reStructuredText, Sphinx, Git, and writing technical documentation.

### Prior Experience

I have worked on an open-source project as a participant in the Season of Docs program, I completed my project and delivered more deliverables than originally planned in the accepted proposal.  
Here’s a [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B_lCimD17SrCLdynABlCiNGapFlmrhpry94Am5taS0g) to my final project report.

### Project Request

I have no responsibilities other than college this summer, if given a chance I can spend 5 hours or more on average a week on volunteering this project.

I am the perfect third volunteer for this project as I am a complete alien to Wechaty and chatbots in particular. During the project, I will try to make my chatbots, using the documentation and hence will be able to point out what exact difficulties new users are facing, and will give a detailed analysis of the documentation which will benefit tech writer understand what exactly documentation is lacking and what should the writer improve.

I am probably the intended user as I know basic coding and have never used Wechaty to create bots. If can make chatbots comfortably at the end of the program using the documentation, that will also be an indication that the project got completed successfully.

### Roles & Responsibilities

* Read the existing documentation
* Proofread the documentation that will be delivered by tech writers
* Give suggestions and feedback on the delivered documentation
* Make chatbots and will point out where the documentation is lacking
* Suggest what else can be done to improve the learning curve of users based on my own learning curve
* Organize Zoom meeting every week
  * Prepare the agenda before meeting
  * Make sure everyone get synced
  * Make sure meeting happens every week and everyone is attending it
* Publish a meeting minutes blog after each meeting
  * Publish meetings on YouTube
  * Send blog post url to our mailing list
* Write and publish monthly report for Wechaty GSoD'21
* Draft case study and final project evaluation for the Wechaty organization

### Communication

The frequency of contact will be dependent on a discussion with other mentors and tech writer(s). I prefer regular communication — my suggestion is once every week to receive updates and to give feedback on the work done so far. However, this is flexible depending on their preferences as well.

### Project Budget & Availability

Availability: I will devote 4-5 hours per week from May to November 30.

Will be available on: weekly Zoom video conferences, Gitter, Github & Gmail.

Budget: $500
