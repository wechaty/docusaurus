## GSoD'21 Performance Stipend Disbursement

We were fortunate enough to have 13 participants in our first ever Google Season of Docs participation. We are glad for their great contributions
to our documentation and thought of rewarding them with a $1000 performance stipend on top of their original stipends. A Google form was
shared as a voting platform for deciding the performance stipend. Every participant had equal vote weightage, and they were allowed to vote for themselves
as well.

### Rationale behind the splits

We felt that everyone worked hard, and it would be unfair to reward only a couple of tech-writers, therefore
we decided to reward everyone who worked sincerely throughout the program. We considered numerous factors while
dividing the performance stipend split, namely individual & team voting scores and experience.

As volunteers were given responsibility for the allocation of the performance stipend, we thought it's best
not to include them in the mathematical formula, as it will disturb other values. Interestingly volunteers got the
highest votes in the poll, maybe because others were aware that I would be responsible for the disbursement. We allocated
$150 for them (1000/13 * 2 == $153), and as they both got an equally highest vote, they both will be getting $75.
