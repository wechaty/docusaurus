### About Me

I considered myself a Polymath. I believe in rigorous and intuitive learning. Spend the majority of the time exploring different types of algorithms and contributing to open source.

I am fascinated by the extensive impact computers can have on solving real-world problems. My interest lies in the fields of Algorithms, Computational Science, and Distributed computing.

### Prior Experiences

I have completed GSoD '20 with gRPC-Gateway, where my work was on Refactoring the Existing Docs Site of gRPC-Gateway, writing docs and tutorials on how to use gRPC-Gateway.

Link: [gRPC-Gateway Documentation Website](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/)

My Google Season of Docs '20 project report can be found here - <https://github.com/iamrajiv/GSoD-2020/blob/master/GSoD_2020_Project_Report.md>.

I have participated in various open-source programs like BITSoC '20 (2nd place), GSSoC '20, JMoC '20, etc. Also, I have contributed to many open-source libraries and projects like SymPy, SunPy, SciRuby, Backstage, gRPC-Gateway, SymEngine, Appwrite, etc.

I am a maintainer and code reviewer for the Tesseract Coding organization. I served as a mentor for Contributor's Hack, DevScript Winter of Coded (DWoC), GirlScript Summer of Code(GSSoC), Winter of Code (WoC), etc.

### Project Request

Since I already participated in GSoD '20, So I think this the right opportunity for me to give back to the community.

I have experience in improving organizations' documentation, mentoring and I can use any version control system, so carrying out commands on GitHub will not be a problem. Moreover, what drives me is working on projects that create value for people and give back to the community. If you want someone to do something in the most efficient way possible, you document it. By documenting your processes, you ensure efficiency, consistency, and peace of mind for anyone involved.

I do not have any other commitments this summer. Therefore, I will be able to manage 5 hrs per week or more for volunteering for this project.

### Responsibilities

My work as Volunteer:

- Going through existing documentation.
- Listing down the things that Wechaty documentation is missing and having a discussion with the team.
- Collaborating with volunteers and technical writers and promote user documentation on how to conduct and configure Wechaty.
- Reviewing the work of technical writers and make sure they are on the right path.
- Reviewing the performance metrics of technical writers and auditing the work according to the proposed task.
- Helping technical writers at the time of issues and setting up Wechaty environment.
- Working with the Technical Steering Committee to prioritize a list of case studies.
- Publishing blog posts and reports and sharing the work of Wechaty to a wide range of audiences.
- At the end of the program making sure every documentation is properly refactored, all grammar mistakes are fixed, broken hyperlinks are fixed, and documentation is appropriately organized.

Suggestions would like to propose about Wechaty documentation:

To facilitate a higher volume of documentation and communications, I would like to propose to develop a system for publishing case studies in addition to our technical documentation. In addition, I want to add markdown documents to our contributor's website for thematic discussions that appeal to a range of audiences.

- Developing a content strategy for Wechaty:

  - Auditing the user experience when navigating Wechaty projects and documentation.
  - Developing a style guide for Wechaty for consistent documentation.
  - Designing overarching content workflow that ensures regular content creation, review, and promotion.

- Prepare documentation on setting up configuration files:

  - Making more visual graphs and architecture diagrams about Wechaty workflow and converting old `.png` images to `.svg` images.
  - Standardize documentation across all of our repositories and improve navigation between Wechaty projects.
  - Auditing the existing documentation and regarding Wechaty configuration as this is currently fragmented and difficult to navigate.
  - Providing a beginner-friendly tutorial.

I will also suggest having multiple milestones to ensure that the technical writer has been following up with our requirements throughout the project duration.

### Communication

I will be in regular contact with technical writers using Email, Gitter, and other communication mediums. In addition, I will assist technical writers with systems documentation and unearthing the technical aspects of Wechaty.

### Project Budget & Availability

Availability: I will devote 4-5 hours per week from May to November.
