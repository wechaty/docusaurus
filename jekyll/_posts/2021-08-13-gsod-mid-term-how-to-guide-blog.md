## Abstract

How to Guide is important because it guides us through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume knowledge of how the product works. On an average 45 - 50% of developers refer to How to guide. It contains instructions on how to use the program, its features and other inbuilt applications as well.

## Proposed Timeline

The detailed structure for the timeline can be found [here](#a). Below are the some of the highlights:

### Week 1

* Concentrate on community bonding.
* Chalk out a blueprint.
* Add a README file to GitHub.

### Week 2

* Add about Bot: Adding brief introduction to the bot and its various use cases and functionalities with images.

### Week 3

* Add Events to your bot: Define what an event is. Provide code snippets along with a brief paragraph about when to use an event. Include code snippets and examples.

### Week 4

* Add more functionality to your bot:

1. Dealing with messages.
2. Manage Contacts.

## Work Done

We kick-off with the community bonding and getting familiar with the project. Also, if someone want's to contribute we had a README file to help future contributors understand how to contribute to the How-to-guide page. We then restructured the How-to-guide section, and added various sub-sections. Some of them are:

1. Adding Events and customising the bot with providing code snippet for better understanding and its purpose
2. Install wechaty and run the most famous messaging app through it
3. Step by step guide to get familiar with deals with messages
4. Introduction to managing contacts and its use cases
5. Step by Step guide to get familiar with manage contacts
6. Step by Step guide to get familiar with send and accept friend requests
7. Introduction to sending and receiving files and its use cases

## Lesson learned

Working with Wechaty under Google Season of Docs has been an amazing and rewarding experience. It has provided me a chance for learning and self improvement. Here are some of the lessons we have learnt:

1. Became more familiar with Git, Github and open source culture and software development in general. Also learnt several md, mdx commands and their best practices.

2. Routine code submission, discussion and review by mentors helped to complete the task in short time and in directed manner.

3. We learned a great deal about working with the Docusaurus documentation system.

## Follow-up work

In the next half, we will be looking for the:

1. Deployment section where we will have the integration with various IM platfrom like WhatsApp, WeChat, Gitter, Lark, WeChat Official Account.
2. Deployment with containers where we will have it running in Heroku and Docker.
3. Review up all the PR and improve the documentation as suggested.

## Acknowledgment

We are extremely grateful to our mentors Rohitesh and Simin for helping us out at various stages throughout this summer. Special thanks to Huan and Rui, for facilitating the Summer Program. Sincere gratitude to Google for offering me this great opportunity.
