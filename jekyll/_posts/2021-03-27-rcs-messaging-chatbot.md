> Rich Communication Services (RCS) is a communication protocol between mobile-telephone carriers and between phone and carrier, aiming at replacing SMS messages with a text-message system that is richer, provides phonebook polling (for service discovery), and can transmit in-call multimedia. It is part of the broader IP Multimedia Subsystem.
  It is also marketed as Advanced Messaging, Chat, joyn, SMSoIP, Message+, and SMS+.
  &mdash; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services)

In China, the telecom operators call the RCS a **5G Chatbot**. (See: [Chinese operators make major RCS commitment: Whitepaper, April 9, 2020](https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/latest-news/china-operators-make-major-rcs-commitment-whitepaper/))

## Conclusion

What I'm thinking about is, if we build a Wechaty Puppet RCS, then our chatbot will be able to run both on the WeChat and the RCS without modify any code! Here's the Wechaty Puppet RCS Wishlist: [Enable RCS Support for Wechaty wechaty/wishlist#53](https://github.com/wechaty/wishlist/issues/53)
