This year, Wechaty organization is applying the [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) program because we want to improve our documentation for the community.

When I'm reading [Google Season of Docs - Project Ideas](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/project-ideas), I found this great talk: [What nobody tells you about documentation, Daniele Procida, 2017, PyCon AU](https://2017.pycon-au.org/schedule/presentation/15/) ([YouTube talk video](https://youtu.be/t4vKPhjcMZg)), which techs me **[The Grand Unified Theory of Documentation](https://documentation.divio.com/)**:

> There is a secret that needs to be understood
  in order to write good software documentation:
  there isnâ€™t one thing called documentation, there are four.
>
> They are: tutorials, how-to guides, technical references, and explanations.
  They represent four different purposes or functions and
  require four different approaches to their creation.
  Understanding the implications of this will
  help improve most documentation - often immensely.

## What nobody tells you about documentation

In the Daniele's 30 minutes talk video, and finished reading his [Documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com/) website, I decided to follow his principle to refactor our Wechaty Documentation website.

> [What nobody tells you about documentation, Daniele Procida, 2017, PyCon AU](https://2017.pycon-au.org/schedule/presentation/15/) ([YouTube talk video](https://youtu.be/t4vKPhjcMZg))

In the above video, Daniele "using real-life examples I'll draw out the key functions of documentation, and how they map onto different ways of writing it. Putting this into practice is simple when armed with some basic guidelines. The benefits are huge, and available with a minimum of effort." ([link](https://2017.pycon-au.org/schedule/presentation/15/))

The most important concept is the following diagram:

By following the above concepts, I re-structured our docs site by a better understanding of what Wechaty documentation should be like, and also great help me to write a better GSoD proposal for submitting to Google.

## Updated docs site
