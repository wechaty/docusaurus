## Google Season of Docs'21 Week 1 meeting

### Meeting Summary

It was the first meeting of GSoD’21 participants after the selection announcement, I was excited to meet them all, I am glad that I got a chance to host this wonderful meeting.

In this meeting, firstly we had a discussion to set up a day and a time for future meetings, after that every participant gave his week summary and told us about their plans for the upcoming week. After that, we discussed whether we should stretch the main project’s timeline or not. Next Simin leads a discussion about documentation structure and style. Later we had a suggestions/Q&A session, and at last, we took a lovely group photo.
