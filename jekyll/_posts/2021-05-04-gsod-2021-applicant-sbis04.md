### Abstract

#### Current State of WeChaty Tutorials

* Users come to Wechaty website seeking how to use Wechaty to build a chatbot application for solving their problems. Unfortunately, the learning curve is not friendly to our users, they always struggle with setting up with their development environment, can not get started with the simplest example source code, and find it hard to know what they can do with our API. This problem leads to us losing lots of new users, increased number of questions asked in the community, and lowered user satisfaction.

* The current version of the Wechaty Tutorials is not properly structured.

* The tutorials on the website needs improvement, and should be beginner friendly.

### Proposed Work

Update the **Tutorials** to include a step-by-step guide (easy for beginners to follow) for achieving the final goal of building a bot.

The Tutorial project should:

* Allow the user to learn by doing
* Get the user started
* Make sure that the tutorial works all the time
* Ensure the user sees results immediately
* Make the tutorial repeatable
* Focus on concrete steps, not abstract concepts
* Provide the minimum necessary explanation
* Focus only on the steps the user needs to take
* Work with the contributor team to update the documentation on the Wechaty site.
* Add easy to follow video tutorials

Each of the documentation page should be structured in a particular format (so that users get familiarized with the format and would be much easier to follow). And, each of the tutorial pages for building a bot should contain an interactive **CodeSandbox** at the end (consisting of minimal code and TODO steps) where they can apply the knowledge that they gained by following the tutorial, and build a bot totally by themselves!

I have included a detailed **structure** (further down the article) of each documentation page that I propose to be followed for every bot building tutorial.

One more thing that I noticed in the Tutorials is the lack of a **defined goal** that the user should expect to achieve at the end of that step-by-step guide. So, there should be a clear description of the goal in the introduction of each tutorial.

### Contributions

Some contributions that I have done to the [Wechaty GitHub repo](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org) are mentioned below:

* Update Getting started - Running locally instructions ([#763](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org/pull/763))
* Update the vorpal demo screenshot ([#780](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org/pull/780))
* Add instructions and interactive sandbox for Vorpal ([#779](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org/pull/779))
* Update vorpal with wechaty doc ([#772](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org/pull/772))
* Update Getting started - Running locally ([#757](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org/pull/757))
* Improve Vorpal docs ([#791](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org/pull/791))
* Update images to use normal Markdown format - Vorpal tutorial page ([#802](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org/pull/802))

### Project Goals (Timeline)

### Before May 1

* Familiarize myself with the current version of the user documentation of Wechaty, and identify the parts that require improvements.

* Make contributions to the Wechaty repository adding some improvements.

### Community bonding

* Set up a communication channel and time (due to timezone difference).
* Refine my goals and set expectations on both sides.
* Discussing about the structure of each tutorial page in documentation.
* Finalize the order of editing the tutorial sections.
* Discuss about the best way to add the interactive CodeSandboxes

### Documentation Period

Wechaty repository [here](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org)

As per the discussion with the community members, start working on a tutorial page - adding the improvements, properly structuring the pages, adding interactive CodeSandbox, adding video walkthrough (if necessary), adding relevant screenshots and defining a goal in the introduction of the tutorial (so that users have the idea of what they will achieve at the end of the tutorial).

A proposed structure of the tutorial documentation is as follows:

* **Introduction** (also include the goal of the tutorial)
* **Try out the bot** (CodeSandbox)
* **Requirements** (tools required to follow the tutorial)
* **Usage** (code snippet - for users who may be searching for how to use the bot in their project, and doesnâ€™t want to go deep into the step-by-step tutorial)*
* **Video tutorial** (optional)*
* **Getting started** (Quick introduction to the required tools and how to setup their development environment to get started building the bot)
* **Building the bot** (step-by-step guide for building the bot, with a CodeSandbox at the end having minimal code and TODO steps where users can try building the bot by themselves directly on the documentation page without installing any tools on their local system)
* **Running the bot** (commands for running the bot locally)
* **Bot demonstration** (commands that they can use with the bot, and maybe a GIF showing the invocation of some of the commands on WeChat or WhatsApp)
* **Conclusion**
* **References**

> *Require some feedback from the community members

### Measuring the projectâ€™s success

The project would be considered successful if after publication of the new documentation:

* The tutorials page views increase by 50%
* The visit duration on tutorials increases by 50% (>2 minutes)
* The bounce rate of tutorials decreases by 30% (<50%)

### Why am I the right person for this project?

I believe I am the right person for this project because I have previous experience of contributing to documentation and how to structure the modules properly so that it is easier for beginners to follow. I have also worked on a comprehensive [cheat sheet](https://blog.codemagic.io/codemagic-yaml-cheatsheet/) in the past, and I am comfortable with Git & GitHub to make the contributions.

I have already started contributing to the documentation of [Wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org) and would love to work on it as a part of the **GSoD 2021**.

### Stipend

Based on work division.

If one technical writer is selected - $5000
