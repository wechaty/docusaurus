## Google Season of Docs'21 fourth meeting

### Meeting Summary

It was the fourth meeting of the GSoDâ€™21 participants, first after the monthly evaluation, before the start of the meeting we received the sad news that the Chirs has fallen sick and Soumi due to her other engagements won't be able to attend the meetup

In this meeting, firstly every participant gave one's week summary and informed the community about their plans for the upcoming week, volunteers and tech writers discussed while tech writers were giving their week summaries. Later we had a suggestions/Q&A session, in which Vasvi raised her concerns and at last, we took a lovely group photo.
