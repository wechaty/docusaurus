This is the End-term Blog for **Wechaty How-to-guide** documentation for which we are working as a part of Google Season of Docs 2021. It is much more than a summer internship program, it is a year-round effort for the organization and some community members.

## Abstract

How to Guide is important because it guides us through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume knowledge of how the product works. On an average 45 - 50% of developers refer to How to guide. It contains instructions on how to use the program, its features and other inbuilt applications as well.

## Work Done

We kick-off with the community bonding and getting familiar with the project.

## Lesson learned

Working with Wechaty under Google Season of Docs has been an amazing and rewarding experience. It has provided me a chance for learning and self improvement. Here are some of the lessons we have learnt:

1. Became more familiar with Git, Github and open source culture and software development in general. Also learnt several md, mdx commands and their best practices.

2. Routine code submission, discussion and review by mentors helped to complete the task in short time and in directed manner.

3. We learned a great deal about working with the Docusaurus documentation system.

4. The most out of it, we learned how to work as a team, made lifelong new connections and know the value of time management during this period.

## Acknowledgment

Our experience in working on this GSoD’21 project with Wechaty was simply awesome. It was one of the best experiences we've ever had. Not only did I get a chance of contributing to such a big real-world project, but also I got to learn a lot throughout the program. We are extremely grateful to our mentors Rohitesh and Simin for helping us out at various stages throughout this summer. Special thanks to Huan and Rui, for facilitating the Summer Program. Sincere gratitude to Google for offering me this great opportunity.
