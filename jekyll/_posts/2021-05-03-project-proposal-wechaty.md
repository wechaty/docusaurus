## Project Proposal

### Abstract

A easy-to-learn tutorials are designed to assist end users to get familiar with the product or service. Good tutorials are very important because it provides an avenue for users to learn how to use a software, its features, tips, tricks. It also reduces support cost and is part of the corporate identity of the product: a good tutorials as well as user documentation is a sign of healthiness of the product, the developer team. Without good tutorials, a user may not know how to do the above things effectively and efficiently. Also User Documentations can play a pivotal role in ensuring a product's success because great communication is and will always be at the heart of any business or product and a great documentation just takes that communication and puts it in a manageable framework that everyone can access for success. At the time of this writing, the Wechaty now has more than 9900 Stargazers over time and the having no downtime after 12th Nov,2020 for the API and FridayBot, this shows that a lot of people all over the world use the Wechaty and may want to read its tutorials for guidance on how to use the the chatbot maker. However, the Wechaty tutorial is currently outdated and incomplete and the Wehchaty community wants to use this project to improve its tutorials and user documentation to enable end users to have a seamless experience when using the Wechaty.

### Current State

Currently, the tutorials are available on its official website. It is obsolete, incomplete,hard to navigate or find information, does not cover code about some programming language of the chatbot maker and some posts and tutorials are written in Chineselanguage which causes a major setback for people who can't read the Language.

### Why is your proposed user documentation an improvement over the current one?

The proposed user tutorials will be structured to improve and ensure efficiency,consistency, and peace of mind for any end user. It will contain written guides and its associated images, include instructions and explanations on how to use each feature of the Wechaty, up to date, allow the user to learn by doing, understandable and translatable in English languages as well all the blogs,posts,video subtitles as
well.

### Analysis

Huan and I had a conversation about the new changes that are to be made with the current tutorials and he shared two links that showed a project’s scope file written with Docusaurus documentation system v2 and a tutorials docs given on wechaty and said they expect to enhance the contents under the tutorial sub menu. The links he shared with me can be found here and here. I researched a lot about these tools to get a better understanding of how it works.

Docusaurus documentation system v2

Docusaurus makes it easy to maintain Open Source documentation websites. Docusaurus currently provides support to help the website use translations, search, and versioning, along with some other special documentation markdown features.Some of its features are :

- Powered by Markdown
- Built Using React
- Ready for Translations
- Document Versioning
- Document Search

It makes design and documentation changes by using the included live server. Also, it publishes the site to GitHub pages or other static file hosts manually, using a script.

### Project Goals

- Allow the user to learn by doing
- Get the user started
- Make sure that the tutorial works all the time
- Ensure the user sees results immediately
- Make the tutorial repeatable
- Focus on concrete steps, not abstract concepts
- Provide the minimum necessary explanation
- Focus only on the steps the user needs to take
- Work with the contributor team to update the documentation on the Wechaty site
