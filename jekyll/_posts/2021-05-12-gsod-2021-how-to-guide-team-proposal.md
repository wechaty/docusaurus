## Proposal Video Presentation

{% include iframe.html src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOc-ZllV3c" %}

## Abstract

How to Guide is important because it guides us through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume knowledge of how the product works. On an average 45 - 50% of developers refer to How to guide. It contains  instructions on how to use the program, its features and other inbuilt applications as well.

## Current State

Currently, the introduction page is available on its [official website](https://wechaty.js.org/docs/howto/). It is obsolete, incomplete and misses information, and does not cover the example images of the steps involved that one needs to get when landing on the How to Guide section.

## Analysis

Huan and we(Vasvi and Abhishek) had a conversation about the changes that are to be made with the current How-to-Guide section.He said that the community expects to improve and have a new overall structure of this section. The links he shared with us can be found [here](https://wechaty.js.org/docs/howto/).

## Why is your proposed user documentation an improvement over the current one?

The proposed How to Guide page will be structured to improve and ensure efficiency, consistency, and peace of mind for any end user. It will contain all the information about how to use the bot and its associated images, including its details and some little explanations on how to use each feature of the Wechaty. It will be kept up to date and have notes to follow inorder to learn by doing.

## Proposed Changes

* **No overview section**: It is theoretical and can get boring for the users to go through an entire page just containing an Overview.
* **Create a Bot**: A simple step by step guide to create a bot using Wechaty. (Installing the bot will be covered in this section only)
* **Add events to your bot**: Explaining what an event is, emphasising how it can add more value to the bot functionality (adding various use cases as well)
* **Add more functionality to your bot** (All the  work that can be automated with the bot):

1. **Dealing with messages**: Step by step guide on writing code for dealing with messages giving a short but clear example.
2. **Manage Contacts**: Step by step guide on writing code for managing contacts giving a short but clear example.
3. **Manage Rooms**: Define a room. Step by step guide on writing code for managing rooms giving a short but clear example.
4. **Send and Accept Friend Requests**: Step by step guide on writing code for sending and accepting friend requests giving a short but clear example.
5. **Sending and Receiving files**: Step by step guide on writing code for sending and receiving files(data) giving a short but clear example.

* **Testing your bot**: Step by step guide on writing code for testing the bot giving a short but clear example.Puppet Mocker & Starter Template are included in this section.
* **Deploying**: A short introduction to Wechaty puppet. This should include a step by step guide to deploy the bot on various instant message systems:

1. Wechat
2. Whatsapp
3. TikTok

## Project Goals
