## Introduction

This is the project report for **Improve the gRPC and OpenAPI ecosystem** which was completed during Google Season of Docs 2021. The status of the project can be regarded as complete due to the fact that all pull requests have been merged and all the initial premises of the project have been fulfilled.

[https://github.com/iamrajiv/GSoD-2021](https://github.com/iamrajiv/GSoD-2021) repository contains details about my work in Google Season of Docs 2021.

## Learnings

I am very glad that I had the opportunity to take part in the Google Season of Docs program project. Participating in this program has helped me to:

- Got involved with an amazing Wechaty community.
- Got to know about Robotic Process Automation (RPA) SDK for Chatbot Makers.
- Learned about Docusaurus, JavaScript XML(JSX), and Progressive web apps (PWAs).
- Got a deeper understanding of Go, gRPC and Swagger UI, etc.

## Acknowledgments

I am deeply grateful to my mentors [Huan LI](https://github.com/huan) and [Li Jiarui](https://github.com/lijiarui) and volunteers [Simin Liao](https://github.com/proudofsimin) and [Rohitesh Kumar Jain](https://github.com/Rohitesh-Kumar-Jain). Mentors and volunteers guided me patiently through the project and were always ready to help, review work in progress, gave feedback regarding the overall shape of the project and the feasibility of certain solutions, and maintained a very friendly, supportive, and stimulating atmosphere on the team. They devoted a lot of time to this project and led the video meetings in a well-organized, yet non-stressful manner. The project could not be completed without the generous feedback and help from the Wechaty team. Last but not least, I would like to thank Google and Google Season of Docs organizers for this initiative.
