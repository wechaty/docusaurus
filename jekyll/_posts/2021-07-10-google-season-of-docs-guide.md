[Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) is an annual program organized by Google.

Here is the related blog:

- [Hello Wechaty GSoD’21 Technical Writers!](https://wechaty.js.org/2021/05/08/gsod-2021-selected-technical-writers/), Written By [Huan](https://wechaty.js.org/contributors/huan/)
- [GSoD'21 First Month Evaluation](https://wechaty.js.org/2021/06/22/gsod-2021-first-month-evaluation/), Written By [Rohitesh Kumar Jain](https://wechaty.js.org/contributors/rohitesh-kumar-jain)

We have some guide for GSoD like what we did in [OSPP - a Chinese clone of Google's summer of code](https://wechaty.js.org/2021/06/24/summer-wechaty-guide/). All of the tech writers involved in the project are required to complete their weekly work and phased work :

- Weekly work
  - Every workday commit
  - [Wechaty GSoD'21 Weekly Follow-Ups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QglSl5JuZuVom84Or8yGhHb3_YbRMDBPgccxoMmnBa0/edit#gid=978979489)
  - Weekly Zoom Meeting
- Phased work
  - Proposal blog
  - Mid-term blog
  - Final blog

## Weekly Work

A volunteer will organize the weekly meeting and write meeting notes & publish blog posts with zoom meeting recording videos on YouTube embedded.

Here is the guideline for video-recording/downloading/uploading

- Download the recording which has a shared screen along with the gallery view
- Crop the video at the beginning and the end of the meeting, the video should start to form the beginning of the meeting
- Add a beautiful thumbnail to the video
- Highlight the most important agenda of the video by adding timestamps like [kick-off meeting recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTkM_XPpFfU)

### PR Reviewing & Approving Workflow

#### For writers

Writers who are in the same team are **REQUIRED** to review each other’s PR, and give “Request changes” or “Approve”
Writers are encouraged to give “Request changes”, “Approve”, or “Comment” to any PRs. (please contribute to the whole team by doing it!)

#### For volunteers

Volunteers are **REQUIRED** to review all PRs created by writers and give “Request changes” or “Approve”

#### Mentors are in charge of reviewing the PR after

- Volunteers create an issue list about the high priority PR
- PR passed all the CI tests (CLA & unit testings)
- PR gets approved by all the project team members (if applicable, 0-1 approval)
- PR gets approved by all volunteers (2 approvals)

## Phased Work
