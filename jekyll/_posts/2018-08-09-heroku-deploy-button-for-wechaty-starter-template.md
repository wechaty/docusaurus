**GitHub Repo: <https://github.com/wechaty/heroku-wechaty-getting-started>**

At Chatie, we’ve created several getting-started tutorials to make developers’ lives easier. Deploying Wechaty Bot has involved following their prospective README’s step-by-step guides.

Today, we’re starting to make deploying Wechaty Bot as easy as clicking a button – the Heroku button.

## What's the `Deploy to Heroku` Button

> The `Deploy to Heroku` button enables users to deploy apps to Heroku without leaving the web browser, and with little or no configuration. The button is ideal for customers, open-source project maintainers or add-on providers who wish to provide their customers with a quick and easy way to deploy and configure a Heroku app.

## What Will I Benefit From the `Deploy to Heroku` Button

1. You can deploy Wechaty Bot in your browser with one click, get your bot online on Heroku, and it's free;
1. You can clone [heroku-wechaty-getting-started](https://github.com/wechaty/heroku-wechaty-getting-started) repository and modify it to fit your needs, then you will get your own _Deploy to Heroku_ button for your own customized bot.

Until then, enjoy!
