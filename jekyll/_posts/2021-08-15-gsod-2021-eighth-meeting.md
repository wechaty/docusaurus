## Google Season of Docs'21 Eighth meeting

### Meeting Summary

It was the eighth meeting of the GSoDâ€™21 participants. Firstly every participant gave one's weekly summary and informed the community
 about their plans for the upcoming week, volunteers and tech writers discussed while tech writers were giving their week summaries.
  Later we discussed comments and questions of the participants, and they all were regarding getting reviews, feedback, & help, and
   at last, we took a lovely group photo. In the end I would like to stress upon the need of faster reviewal and merging of the PRs,
    after listening everyone at the meet.
