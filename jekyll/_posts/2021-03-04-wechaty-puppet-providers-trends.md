Do you want know which **Wechaty Puppet Provider** is most used by our Wechaty developers?

## Wechaty Puppet Provider (WPP)

Different IM systems need different Wechaty Puppets, and they have different names, and all implementing the Wechaty Puppet API; we call them the **Wechaty Puppet Provider**. For example, the WPP who is supporting WeChat is named [wechaty-puppet-wechat](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet-wechat), supporting Whatsapp is named [wechaty-puppet-whatsapp](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet-whatsapp), and supporting Lark is named [wechaty-puppet-lark](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet-lark). And our community are also building the [Wechaty Puppet Service (Providers)](https://wechaty.js.org/2021/01/14/wechaty-puppet-service/) for any RPA protocol.

## The Trends

We are very interested in how many users choose which WPP. Luckily, an open-source project named [NPM Trends](https://github.com/johnmpotter/npm-trends) is an NPM package comparison app hosted at npmtrends.com written by John Potter.

So we can get to know how many users are using which WPP in the past:
