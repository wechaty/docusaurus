- **Getting started**

  Quick introduction to the required tools and how to setup their development environment to get started building the bot

- **Building the bot**

  Step-by-step guide for building the bot, with a **CodeSandbox** at the end having minimal code and *TODO* steps where users can try building the bot by themselves directly on the documentation page without installing any tools on their local system
