## About

I am a technical writing enthusiast and I always used to do the documentation part of any project my group was assigned (apart from the project of course!), I am also a past participant of Google Season of Docsâ€™20. I am a Bachelor of Engineering undergrad pursuing Computer Science and Engineering from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University. I have a working proficiency in English. I am comfortable with reStructuredText, Sphinx, Git, and writing technical documentation.

## Prior Experience

I have worked on an open-source project as a participant in the Season of Docs program, I completed my project and delivered more deliverables than originally planned in the accepted proposal.
