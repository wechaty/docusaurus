I’m Yao Su, pursuing my bachelor degree of Bioinformatics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
I'm good at mathematical modeling and statistics, especially the implementation of the algorithms.
I'm proficient in Julia language and pretty active in the Julia Chinese Community.
And I'm also familiar with Rust, C/C++ and Python.
And I'm working on the [JuziBot](https://github.com/deepdialog/JuziBot), an information management bot based on wechaty.
I hope to learn how to cooperate in engineering development and contribute my efforts in Juzi.
