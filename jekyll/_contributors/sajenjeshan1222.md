## About

I am a sophomore undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science from India. I have acted as a resource person on topics like ML, DL and orientation on online course awareness in colleges and universities. I have also organised and taken a few webinars regarding machine learning during COVID-19 pandemic.

I am passionate about making interactive tutorials, documentation and deep learning. I have worked on projects regarding R-CNN, LSTM and deep learning in my university. I am familiar working with JS/typescript and popular frameworks like angular, react, node.js, django and flask, I will also do UI development and documentation and I have writing experience by working in paper publications.

I am good with popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, keras, SciKit Learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib. I have cracked the qualifier round of google code jam 2020, completed the Google Code-in competition in 2017 and completed hacktoberfest 2020
