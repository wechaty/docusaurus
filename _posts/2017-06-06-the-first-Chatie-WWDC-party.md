On June 6, 2017, at 6 PM, we held the First Chatie Worldwide Developers Conference(WWDC) Party in the Su Shi Restaurant of Wudaokou, Beijing. 

The Conference consists of a small group of seven people, and the theme is about ChatBot and Artificial Intelligence in all aspects. The Participants include PNP Investors Li Zhuohuan, Orange Interactive Founder Li Jiarui, and Zhou Zainan who graduated from Tsinghua University, currently works in Google Adwords, a amateur who combined chatbot and Wechat group; And Chou Daohan who majored in business and undergraduated in Europe, and will be admitted to the University of Birmingham in computer science department; and Zhou Shuai who works in the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute in Automation, in CBSR Laboratory, and researches in face recognition and face attribute analysis; And Zhao Wenjun who is a graduate student in Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, studying assiduously in Machine Learning; and the author of Book "Technical Analysis And Practice in TensorFlow", TensorFlow community's Founder Li Jiaxuan. We open an interesting ChatBot Summit together.

In the Conference, everyone got the newly released Wechaty Logo which Li Jiarui gave us as a gift. At the same time, Zhou Zaonan and Li Jiarui discussed with the Typescript language to optimize Chatie/angular project continuously. Li Zhuohuan([@zixia](https://github.com/zixia)) also give some useful suggestions for TensorFlow Community to help more beginners interested in Machine Learning. Jiarui and I also discussed an inovated program, hoping to make a more intelligent "brain" of the Wechaty robot, with deep learning methods, integrates the useful information together in Wechat Group.

Finally, we also visited the PNP Incubator located on Zhizao Avenue, Zhongguancun. Jia Rui took out the Japanese wine "White Island", which has been treasured for many years. We had a happy drinking experience. I also have a fortunately chance to take a photo with Li ZhuoHuan, who is the great recommender of my book.

Who says the Conference can only be held once a year? We look forward the next Summit. Thanks a million for Li Zhuohuan's generosity, and the next time, it is our treat for you.

You can also pay a attention for Li Jiaxuan's this book "Technical Analysis And Practice in TensorFlow", for the establishment of deep learning knowledge system for beginners: http://item.jd.com/12073631.html



## 第一届Chatie-WWDC聚会大事记

2017年6月6日，18时，在五道口的苏轼酒楼，召开了第一届Chatie-WWDC聚会。

这是一个七人小团体的畅聊，主题是关于ChatBot和人工智能的方方面面。参会的包括PNP的投资人李卓桓老师，桔子互动创始人李佳芮美女，以及毕业于清华大学，目前在谷歌做adwords，业余用聊天机器人和微信群结合的周载南；在欧洲读书，本科商科，即将入读伯明翰大学计算机科学研究生的大帅锅种道涵；在中国科学院自动化研究所，CBSR实验室，进行人脸识别，人脸属性分析的周帅；在北邮研究生在读，对机器学习钻研很深入的赵文骏；还有《TensorFlow技术解析与实战》的作者、TensorFlow技术社区的创建者李嘉璇一起开了一场有趣有料的关于ChatBot的峰会~~

这是各个大牛们给大家的问候~~ （加视频）

聚会上，每人都拿到了新出炉的Wechaty的Logo标志；会上“段子手”周载南和李佳芮一起讨论了用Typescript继续优化Chatie/angular项目；李老师也给TensorFlow技术社区一些能帮助到更多机器学习入门者的有用建议；我和佳芮美女也探讨了方案，希望把wechaty做成一个更加智能有“脑”的机器人，用深度学习的方法，将微信群里的有用资讯汇总起来给大家。 （大合影，李老师和周载南的合影……）

最后，我们还参观了位于中关村智造大街的PNP孵化器，佳芮还拿出了珍藏多年的日本酒“白洲”，喝的一手好杜康。我也有幸和书本的推荐人李老师合影。

谁说大会只能一年办一次？我们期待下一次再聚会~~谢谢李老师的慷慨，下次一定由我们请您

大家也可以关注一下李嘉璇的这本畅销书《TensorFlow技术解析与实战》，对于建立深度学习知识体系很有帮助：http://item.jd.com/12073631.html
