With the development of science and technology, the progress of the society is related to create something useful. And to a certain extent,  the software developers are capable of changing the world.  Last Friday, I was lucky for having an enjoyable conversation with several coders together.

There were 7 guys came to the gathering (including me), 6 programmers, and one used to work for a technical community. We met at 7 pm and would have dinner together in a Chinese restaurant. We’d like to introduce ourselves to each other at the beginning of the meeting with a video recorded.

Here is the Chinese version. 

4 月 21 日，周五，在北京这个妖风四起满世界柳絮的春天，跟几个朋友一起吃了顿饭。

虽然讲是“吃饭”，其实主要是跟几个技术圈的朋友聊聊天，互通有无，搞技术的人，最怕故步自封，多交流才能保持进步，吃饭只是顺便的事儿。

下午 7 点，虽然晚高峰，但是大家都很给力，如约到达了事先约好的地方。其实这次线下聚会的 7 个人并非都是互相熟悉的，所以刚开始见面的时候，颇有种“见网友”的感觉，好在开发者谈起技术问题来，就满腔热忱，口若悬河，所以大家很快就熟悉了。
