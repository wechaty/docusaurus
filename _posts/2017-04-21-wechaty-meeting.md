With the development of science and technology, the progress of the society is related to create something useful. And to a certain extent,  the software developers are capable of changing the world.  Last Friday, I was lucky for gathering several coders together and we had an enjoyable conversation.

There were 7 guys came to the gathering (including me), 5 programmers, and one used to work for a technical community. We met at 7 pm and would have dinner together in a Chinese restaurant. We’d like to introduce ourselves to each other at the beginning of the meeting with a video recorded.

4 月 21 日，周五，在北京这个妖风四起满世界柳絮的春天，跟几个朋友一起吃了顿饭。

虽然讲是“吃饭”，其实主要是跟几个技术圈的朋友聊聊天，互通有无，搞技术的人，最怕故步自封，多交流才能保持进步，吃饭只是顺便的事儿。

下午 7 点，虽然晚高峰，但是大家都很给力，如约到达了事先约好的地方。其实这次线下聚会的 7 个人并非都是互相熟悉的，所以刚开始见面的时候，颇有种“见网友”的感觉，好在开发者谈起技术问题来，就满腔热忱，口若悬河，所以大家很快就熟悉了。

简单介绍一下大家：

王海良：Rockq 社区领袖，呤呤英语 AI Lead，曾就职 IBM 创新中心、研发中心，他也是 Chatbot 开发者。

向宇：Tech geek，全栈开发工程师，就职于联想。对爬虫，3D打印，前端开发，网络等方向积累丰富经验。他也是 wechaty contributor，贡献了 wechaty 发送图片功能。

李佳芮：全栈开发、chatbot 开发者，桔子互动创始人，爵士舞爱好者，业余创建舞蹈社群，全网播放过千万，wechaty contritubor，wechaty 社群发起人。

刘连响：DotEngine 创始人， 音视频实时通信领域连续创业者。

羊三岁： 前掘金社区运营、市场策划，掘金翻译计划负责人，目前就职于 tag Design ，负责市场活动和内容运营，是一个会讲法语的市场妹子。

赵磊：96 年大三小鲜肉，擅长 Python 网络及爬虫开发，大型数字化校园系统架构开发，钟情研究投行量化交易系统，并希望以此作为出国读研学习方向。

很开心能把大家聚在一起，共同探讨技术问题并增进对彼此的了解，希望日后能多一些线下交流的机会。
