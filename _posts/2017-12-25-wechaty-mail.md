As soon as I learn how to use 6 lines of JavaScript to achieve a simple chatbot based on [Wechaty](https://github.com/Chatie/wechaty), I was deeply attracted and decide to develop an easy-to-use email tool based on it. [Wechaty-Mail](https://github.com/wnbupt/wechaty_email) is an application based on Wechaty which can help you get notifications in WeChat when you receive new emails.
