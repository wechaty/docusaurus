<https://wechaty.js.org> is the official Wechaty website for publishing latest news, blog posts, and documentation from our open source community.

## How To Post a Blog

To submit a blog post for publication on [wechaty.js.org](https://wechaty.js.org), you can follow the steps below.

1. Fork this repository. If you don't know what is meant by forking a repository, read about it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine. If you don't know how to do that, [this article](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) explains it well
3. Make sure your forked repository is in sync with the main repository. If you don't know how to sync a forked repository,read about it in [this article](https://help.github.com/cn/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork)
4. We prefer using [gitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Therefore start by creating a branch for your blog using the command `git checkout -b name-of-blog-branch`. Give the branch a meaningful name
5. Create a markdown file in [jekyll/\_posts](./jekyll/_posts) folder. The file name should follow the format `YYYY-MM-DD-your-blog-slug.md`. For example `2016-12-03-welcome-to-wechaty.md`
6. Write your blog in markdown in the file you created in the previous step. If you are not familiar with markdown syntax, you can learn it [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
7. Add related images to [jekyll/assets](./jekyll/assets) folder under `$YEAR/$MONTH-your-blog-slug/` directory
8. Add your info into `jekyll/_contributors/your_github_id.md`
9. Commit your changes using the command `git commit -am "YOUR_BLOG_TITLE"`. `YOUR_BLOG_TITLE` is the title of your blog
10. Push you branch to github using the command `git push origin name-of-blog-branch`.
11. Create new Pull Request(PR)
12. Sign the [CLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement)
13. Wait for the continuous integration workflow run to finish. If it is failing, fix whatever is making it to fail so that CI turns green
14. Wait for @wechaty/editors to review your PR

That's it!

## Guidelines For Writing a Blog Post

### 1. Your blog post should have a Header

The header of your blog post should have a title, author and image.

This is illustrated in the example below:

```yaml
---
title: "'Score Your Face Photo' a ML&Wechaty practice"
author: your_github_username
image: your_teaser_image_path
---
<One line abstract for your blog post>

<Your beautiful blog post contents...>
```

### 2. Writing Style

- You should keep all filenames and URLs as lowercase. Use `-` character between words instead of space when creating a new file or directory. e.g. `2017-10-06-wechat-pc-impactor` instead of `2017-10-06-WeChat PC Impactor`. No Chinese should be used in any filename.
- Find a good image for the blog to make it more beautiful.
- You should embed photos and videos before publishing, save all external files to the `/jekyll/assets/${YEAR}/$MONTH-your-blog-slug/` directory.

### 3. Do Not Commit Unrelated Files

Please do not commit unrelated files. It will keep things tidy and make it easier to review your PR.

### 4. How To Add Videos and PDFs To Your Blog Post

You can add videos and PDFs to your blog post by using the syntax below.

Example of how to add video or pdf

```html
{% include iframe.html src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eq8wJfCAWs" %}
```

or

```html
{% include iframe.html src="/assets/2020/qijibot/final.pdf" %}
```

## How To Run Tests

```sh
npm install
npm test
```

## How To Preview Your changes

If you want to preview your blog post or changes on locahost, you need to have Jekyll installed in your machine. You can follow the [jekyll quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) instructions to install jekyll.

### 1. Install Jekyll by Hand

Run Jekyll at localhost to preview your blog post by running the commands below.

```sh
make install
cd jekyll

```
