```

### 2. Writing Style

* Keep all filenames & url as lowercase, and use `-` to connect words instead of space. e.g. `2017-10-06-wechat-pc-impactor` instead of `2017-10-06-WeChat PC Impactor`
* Find a good image for the blog to make it more beautiful.
* Embed the photo & video before publishing, save all external file to the blog `/assets/2018` directory.
